# FAT Architecture

FAT is an ERPNext-style ERP built as a **modular monolith** in TypeScript. This
document explains the design; see the root `README.md` for how to run it.

## Why a modular monolith

A single deployable process, but with hard internal module boundaries. Business
modules (CRM, Selling, Buying, Stock, Accounting, HR) are separate NestJS
modules that share one database and one process, yet do not import each other's
service code. Cross-module references are expressed as **data** (Link fields) and
**events**, not as compile-time dependencies. This keeps the codebase easy to
reason about and deploy, while preserving the option to split a module out later.

## The DocType engine (the core)

Everything a business module does flows through a metadata-driven engine modelled
on Frappe's DocType system.

```
*.doctype.json  ──load──▶  tabDocType / tabDocField / tabDocPerm  (metadata)
                                   │
                                   ├─ SchemaSyncService ──▶  tab<DocType>  (physical table, real columns)
                                   ├─ DocumentService   ──▶  generic CRUD REST API
                                   ├─ ValidationService ──▶  zod validation from field metadata
                                   ├─ PermissionService ──▶  role-based access per DocType
                                   └─ MetaController    ──▶  metadata for the dynamic UI
```

- **Definition** — each module ships version-controlled `*.doctype.json` files.
  On boot (`DoctypeLoaderService`) they are upserted into the metadata tables and
  registered in an in-memory `DoctypeRegistryService`.
- **Physical storage** — `SchemaSyncService` reconciles each DocType into a real
  Postgres table `tab<Name>` with a column per field (Frappe's model), not a
  JSONB bag. It is **additive only** (never drops columns) and idempotent.
- **CRUD** — one `DocumentController` at `/api/resource/:doctype` serves every
  DocType. The pipeline is: resolve meta → check permission → naming → validate →
  validate links → write parent + child rows in one transaction → emit lifecycle
  event.
- **Validation** — driven entirely by field metadata via the field-type registry
  (`core/field-types`), which maps each fieldtype to a Postgres column type, a
  coercion function, and a zod validator. The same fieldtype enum is shared with
  the frontend through `@fat/shared`.
- **Permissions** — `tabDocPerm` rows grant roles rights (read/write/create/
  delete/submit/cancel/report) per DocType, with field-level `permlevel`. Mirrors
  Frappe. `Administrator`/`System Manager` bypass.
- **Naming** — `hash`, `prompt`, `field:<f>`, or `series:<PATTERN>` (atomic
  counter in `tabSeries`, e.g. `SO-00001`).
- **Submit/cancel** — submittable DocTypes use `docstatus` (0 draft / 1 submitted
  / 2 cancelled); submitted documents are immutable.

## Cross-module boundaries

- **Links, not imports.** A Sales Invoice (Accounting) referencing a Customer
  (CRM) uses a Link field (`options: "Customer"`) resolved generically by the
  engine. No module imports another module's services.
- **Events, not calls.** Behavioural coupling uses `EventEmitter2` via
  `HooksService`. Example: `StockLedgerListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Stock Entry`; `GlPostingListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Sales Invoice`. Dependencies stay unidirectional.
- **Shared masters.** Company, Currency, UOM, Territory, Customer/Item Group,
  Fiscal Year live in `core-domain` so any module can link to them.

## Frontend — the dynamic "Desk"

The Next.js app has no per-DocType React code. Two generic routes —
`/app/[doctype]` (list) and `/app/[doctype]/[name]` (form) — fetch metadata from
`/api/meta/:doctype` and render:

- `DynamicListView` — columns from `in_list_view`, filters from
  `in_standard_filter`.
- `DynamicForm` — one renderer per fieldtype from a registry
  (`components/form/fields`), including a `LinkField` typeahead and a `TableField`
  child grid. Save/Submit/Cancel/Delete buttons honour the permission booleans in
  the meta payload.

## Data-access choice

TypeORM manages the **fixed** framework entities (`tabDocType`, `tabDocField`,
`tabDocPerm`, `tabSeries`, `tabRole`, `tabHasRole`, `tabUser`). The **dynamic**
`tab<DocType>` tables are managed by `SchemaSyncService` via parameterized raw
SQL / DDL over the same connection. Prisma was rejected because its static,
compile-time schema cannot express runtime-defined tables. All dynamic SQL uses
parameterized values and an allowlist of column identifiers derived from
validated metadata.

## Ledgers, reports, jobs, and row-level permissions

- **Ledgers.** On submit, Accounting posts balanced double-entry `GL Entry`
  records (debit Debtors / credit Sales) and Stock posts `Stock Ledger Entry`
  movements; both reverse on cancel. Implemented purely as event listeners
  (`gl-posting.listener.ts`, `stock-ledger.listener.ts`) — no cross-module
  service imports.
- **Reports.** `GET /api/report/:doctype` returns group-by aggregations
  (count / sum), honouring filters and row-level permissions. The frontend
  `/report/[doctype]` renders a bar breakdown; a print view lives at
  `/app/[doctype]/[name]/print`.
- **Background jobs.** `JobService` runs jobs on a BullMQ queue when `REDIS_HOST`
  is set, and inline otherwise — identical calling code either way. The
  `recompute_totals` job sums child-table line amounts into `total`/`grand_total`.
- **Row-level permissions.** `User Permission` records restrict a user to
  specific records; `DocumentService.list`/`canAccessRow` filter list results and
  block direct reads of disallowed rows.

## Phase 8 — depth, workflow, analytics, developer platform

- **Accounting/Stock depth.** Sales/Purchase tax child tables feed the
  `recompute_totals` job (net → taxes → grand_total). A `Bin` DocType holds
  per-item-per-warehouse moving-average valuation, maintained by the stock ledger
  listener; Delivery Note / Purchase Receipt / Payment Entry all post via the
  event bus. `GET /api/query-report/:name` serves Trial Balance & Stock Balance.
- **Workflow & audit.** `WorkflowService` runs role-gated state machines
  (`/api/workflow/...`) that submit/cancel documents; `VersionListener` records a
  diff on every update; Comment/File DocTypes + `POST /api/upload` (served at
  `/files`); `if_owner` perms scope reads to the owner.
- **UX & analytics.** Home dashboard (report-driven charts), `GET /api/search`
  global search, per-DocType saved filters, and a Print Format engine
  (`GET /api/print/...` renders `{{ field }}` templates).
- **Developer platform.** In-app DocType builder (`POST /api/admin/doctype` →
  live table), `Webhook` DocType + listener, API keys
  (`Authorization: token <key>:<secret>`), and an OpenAPI spec at
  `/api/openapi.json` with docs at `/api/docs`.

## Phase 9 — realism, platform, scale

- **Accounting realism.** Multi-currency (`conversion_rate` + base amounts; GL
  posts in base), tax-account split in GL (Dr Debtors / Cr Sales / Cr tax
  accounts), payment reconciliation (`Payment Entry Reference` → invoice
  outstanding + Paid/Unpaid), and per-item **FIFO** valuation (layers on `Bin`)
  alongside moving average.
- **Platform.** Real-time updates over **SSE** (`GET /api/stream` →
  `RealtimeBridge` invalidates React Query), **scheduled jobs** (`@nestjs/schedule`
  + on-demand `POST /api/admin/run-scheduled`), in-app **Notifications** (bell +
  listener + overdue sweep), and a **visual workflow designer** (`/desk/workflow`).
- **Scale.** `RegistrySyncService` keeps every instance's metadata cache coherent
  via Redis pub/sub — a DocType created on one node is picked up live by the
  others (verified with two instances), closing the multi-instance gap.

## Phase 10 — completeness, interop, hardening

- **Accounting completeness.** Batch tracking (`Batch` DocType + `batch_no` on
  stock movements/ledger + batch-wise stock balance), cost centers (stamped on
  GL), budgets + Budget-vs-Actual, and **Profit & Loss / Balance Sheet**
  query-reports (GL joined to `Account.account_type`).
- **Platform interop/views.** Email transport for notifications (nodemailer;
  log-only until SMTP), CSV **import/export** (`/api/resource/:doctype/export|import`),
  **Kanban** (drag between Select columns) and month **Calendar** views, and
  server-rendered **PDF** print (`/api/print/.../pdf` via the bundled Chromium).
- **Hardening.** `@nestjs/throttler` rate limiting, an audit-log **retention**
  sweep (`RETENTION_DAYS`), an **RBAC admin** UI/endpoints (`/desk/rbac`,
  `/api/admin/rbac`), and a **Playwright e2e** suite (`apps/e2e`) wired into a
  dedicated CI job that seeds + boots both apps and runs the specs.

## Phase 11 — serial/batch depth, POS, GraphQL

- **Stock depth.** Serial numbers (`Serial No` DocType; `serial_no` on stock
  movements + ledger; the stock-ledger listener creates serials Active on receipt
  and flips them Delivered on issue) and **per-batch valuation** — `Bin` is now
  keyed by `item::warehouse::batch`, so moving-average/FIFO cost is tracked per
  batch and the stock-balance report re-aggregates back to item+warehouse.
- **Period close.** `Period Closing Voucher` (submittable): the GL listener zeroes
  every income/expense balance and books the net profit/loss into the equity
  closing account (Retained Earnings) with a balanced entry, reversible on cancel.
- **Point of Sale.** `/pos` rings up a sale — one tap posts a Sales Invoice + a
  reconciled Payment Entry. It is **offline-resilient**: when offline or the server
  is unreachable the order is persisted to a localStorage queue and retried
  automatically on reconnect (invoice name is stamped before payment so a
  mid-sequence retry never duplicates the invoice).
- **GraphQL alongside REST.** One generic Apollo (code-first) schema over the
  DocType engine — `documents`/`document` queries and `saveDocument`/
  `submitDocument`/`cancelDocument`/`deleteDocument` mutations — reusing
  `DocumentService` and the same permission checks. The global JWT guard,
  `CurrentUser`, and the throttler are execution-context aware (`requestFrom()`)
  so auth applies to REST and GraphQL alike.

## Phase 12 — Manufacturing, Projects, Assets

- **Manufacturing.** `BOM` (production item + raw-material rows) and `Work Order`
  (submittable). Submitting a Work Order emits a Stock Entry with a new
  **Manufacture** purpose that issues the BOM's materials from the source
  warehouse and receives the finished good into the target warehouse at the
  rolled-up material cost per unit (via `basic_rate` on the entry line); the
  order flips to Completed and cancel reverses the whole entry.
- **Projects.** `Project`, `Task`, and a submittable `Timesheet`. Submitting a
  Timesheet computes `billable_amount = hours × rate` (billable lines only) and
  rolls hours + amount onto the Project; cancel unwinds the rollup.
- **Assets.** `Asset` (submittable) + `Depreciation Entry` (submittable). A
  Depreciation Entry auto-computes the straight-line annual charge when left
  blank (never below salvage), books **Dr Depreciation Expense / Cr Accumulated
  Depreciation** to the GL, and steps the asset's accumulated depreciation,
  current value and status; cancel reverses the GL and unwinds the asset.
- Each module is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + one event listener,
  no cross-module service imports) and surfaces automatically in the
  metadata-driven Desk sidebar, list and form views.

## Phase 13 — Payroll, Pricing, Support

- **Payroll.** `Salary Component` (Earning/Deduction + GL account),
  `Salary Structure` (earnings/deductions child tables), and a submittable
  `Salary Slip`. On submit the listener reads the structure, computes gross /
  total deduction / net pay, and posts a balanced journal — Dr each earning
  account (Σ = gross), Cr each deduction account, Cr the payable account (net);
  cancel reverses the GL.
- **Pricing rules.** A new **pre-write engine hook** (`HooksService.applyBeforeSave`,
  invoked by `DocumentService.create`/`update` before validation) lets listeners
  transform raw input. `PricingRuleListener` uses it to match each selling line
  against active `Pricing Rule`s (by item code / item group, optionally scoped to
  a customer and above a minimum qty) and set a fixed rate or apply a discount %;
  the recompute-totals job then derives amounts/totals from the adjusted rates.
- **Support.** `Service Level Agreement` (per-priority first-response and
  resolution targets) and `Issue`. The support listener stamps `response_by` /
  `resolution_by` from the applicable SLA on creation, and on Resolved/Closed
  compares the resolution time to the deadline to mark the agreement
  Fulfilled/Failed (direct SQL write-backs avoid event re-entry).
- Each module is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + one event listener, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk sidebar,
  list and form views.

## Phase 14 — CRM pipeline, Subscriptions, Loyalty

- **CRM pipeline.** `Lead` and `Opportunity` gain conversion behaviour: marking a
  Lead "Converted" creates a `Customer` (once) and links it back; marking an
  Opportunity "Converted" builds a draft `Quotation` from its items (new
  `Opportunity Item` child) and links it back. Idempotent via the stamped
  back-links. The Pricing Rule listener is now gated to billing transactions
  (those with a `grand_total` field) so pre-sales Opportunities are not priced
  and the converted Quotation is discounted exactly once.
- **Subscriptions.** `Subscription Plan` + `Subscription`. A daily cron (and
  `POST /api/admin/run-subscriptions`, with an optional `as_of` date) bills every
  Active subscription whose `next_invoice_date` has arrived — raising and
  submitting a Sales Invoice from the plan via the generic `DocumentService` (so
  GL posts through the normal event path), then advancing the date and recording
  the run. It waits for the async recompute-totals job before submitting so GL
  posts the real amount.
- **Loyalty.** `Loyalty Program` + a `Loyalty Point Entry` ledger. Submitting a
  Sales Invoice earns `floor(grand_total × collection_factor)` points under the
  default active program (Accrual entry), reversed when the invoice is cancelled;
  redemptions are negative entries and the balance (sum of entries) is served at
  `GET /api/loyalty/balance/:customer`.
- Each is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + a listener/service, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk.

## Phase 15 — Supply-chain & inventory control

- **Stock Reconciliation.** A submittable `Stock Reconciliation` asserts absolute
  counted quantities per item+warehouse. On submit the Stock listener reads the
  current `Bin` balance and posts a Stock Ledger Entry for the *difference* only,
  reusing the shared moving-average/FIFO posting so the Bin lands exactly on the
  counted qty (and, for Opening Stock, an explicit valuation rate). It stamps
  each row's current/difference qty and the voucher's net valuation change;
  cancel reverses the same delta. No new ledger code — it rides the existing
  `post()`/`reverse()` path, so a reconciliation is just another voucher type.
- **Auto-reorder → Material Request → Purchase Order.** Items gain
  `reorder_level`/`reorder_qty`. A `ReorderService` (daily cron + `POST
  /api/buying/run-reorder`) sums on-hand qty across every Bin per reorder-enabled
  item and raises a single submitted `Material Request` (type Purchase) for the
  shortfall. `POST /api/buying/material-request/:name/make-purchase-order`
  converts a submitted request into a draft `Purchase Order`, marks the request
  Ordered, links the two, and stamps each line's ordered qty — all through the
  generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module service imports.
- **Quality Inspection.** This phase adds an awaitable **pre-submit gate** to the
  engine: `HooksService.applyBeforeSubmit` fires `doc.before_submit(:Doctype)`
  via `emitAsync` before a document transitions to submitted, and a listener that
  throws aborts the submit. The `Quality` module uses it two ways: a
  `before_save` hook derives a `Quality Inspection`'s status from its readings
  grid (Rejected if any reading fails), and a `before_submit:Purchase Receipt`
  gate (registered with `suppressErrors: false` so the thrown error propagates
  instead of being swallowed by the event emitter) blocks a receipt whose
  inspection-required items lack a submitted, Accepted inspection referencing it.
- Each is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + a listener/service, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk.

## Phase 16 — HR & Payroll depth

- **Leave management.** `Leave Type` + a submittable `Leave Allocation` grant a
  balance; there is no separate ledger — balance is derived live as Σ(submitted
  allocations) − Σ(submitted applications' days) in `HrService`. A `before_save`
  hook stamps a Leave Application's inclusive day count, and the awaitable
  `before_submit` gate (added in Phase 15, and which the Leave-Approval workflow
  routes through via `setDocStatus`) blocks approval when the balance is
  insufficient — again registered with `suppressErrors: false`. Served at
  `GET /api/hr/leave-balance/:employee`.
- **Attendance & payroll proration.** An `Attendance` doctype records a status per
  employee/day. This closes a prior known limitation: the Payroll listener now
  computes a payment factor for a Salary Slip's period — Σ(attendance days, where
  Present/On Leave = 1 and Half Day = 0.5) ÷ `total_working_days` — and scales
  earnings by it before posting, so loss-of-pay reaches the GL. When no period or
  no attendance is recorded it defaults to full pay (factor 1), keeping existing
  slips unchanged. Payroll reads `tabAttendance` by SQL — no service import.
- **Expense Claim.** A submittable `Expense Claim` (+ `Expense Claim Detail`
  grid). On submit an HR listener books a balanced journal — Dr each line to its
  account (or a general employee-expense account) and Cr the total to the
  employee payable account — reversed on cancel, mirroring the Payroll/GL
  listeners' voucher pattern.
- Everything stays on the event bus: HR/Payroll import no other module's
  services, reading sibling tables by SQL and posting through the generic
  `DocumentService`.

## Phase 17 — Returns & landed cost

- **Sales Return / Credit Note.** A `Sales Invoice` gains `is_return` +
  `return_against`. The GL listener branches on it: a credit note debits Sales
  and tax and credits Debtors (the mirror of an invoice) using absolute amounts,
  since the return's own totals are negative, and sets a **negative outstanding**.
  No mutation of the original invoice — the customer's net receivable is simply
  the Debtors balance across both documents (verified: 225 − 100 = 125).
- **Delivery Note return.** A `Delivery Note` gains `is_return` + `return_against`.
  The stock listener posts a **positive** movement (goods back in at current
  valuation) instead of an issue; the existing `reverse()` handles cancel because
  the return's Stock Ledger Entry simply carries a positive `actual_qty`.
- **Landed Cost Voucher.** References a `Purchase Receipt` and an additional cost
  to spread across its items (by amount = qty×rate, or by qty). On submit it bumps
  each item's `Bin` `stock_value` and recomputes `valuation_rate`, recording each
  share as a **zero-quantity** Stock Ledger Entry; cancel reads those entries to
  subtract the shares back out and re-derive the rate. No new GL — Purchase
  Receipts value stock via the stock ledger, so landed cost rides the same path.
- Everything reuses the existing GL/stock voucher patterns — the returns are
  branches on `is_return`, and landed cost is another Bin-valuation voucher — so
  no cross-module service imports are added.

## Known limitations (still open)

- Multi-currency has a single conversion rate (no revaluation); serial numbers
  track status/movement but not per-serial valuation.
- Email is log-only without SMTP; SSE stream is unauthenticated (doctype + name
  only); webhooks/print are best-effort.
- POS offline retry can duplicate a *payment* (not the invoice) if the invoice
  submitted but the client never saw the response; GraphQL exposes no
  subscriptions yet.
- The DocType builder does not yet edit child-table field layouts in the UI.
- Pricing Rules apply a single best (highest-priority) match per line — no rule
  stacking or margin/validity-date windows. SLA deadlines are elapsed-hours
  based (no business-hours calendar, holidays, or pause). Payroll proration is
  attendance-day based only (no per-component LWP config, and deductions are not
  prorated).
- Subscriptions bill a single-line invoice per plan (no proration, tax templates,
  or dunning); loyalty redemption is recorded as a ledger entry but is not yet
  auto-applied as an invoice discount; a partial update that omits a child table
  replaces it (clients submit the whole document).
