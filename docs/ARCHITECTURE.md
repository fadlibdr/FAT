# FAT Architecture

FAT is an ERPNext-style ERP built as a **modular monolith** in TypeScript. This
document explains the design; see the root `README.md` for how to run it.

## Why a modular monolith

A single deployable process, but with hard internal module boundaries. Business
modules (CRM, Selling, Buying, Stock, Accounting, HR) are separate NestJS
modules that share one database and one process, yet do not import each other's
service code. Cross-module references are expressed as **data** (Link fields) and
**events**, not as compile-time dependencies. This keeps the codebase easy to
reason about and deploy, while preserving the option to split a module out later.

## The DocType engine (the core)

Everything a business module does flows through a metadata-driven engine modelled
on Frappe's DocType system.

```
*.doctype.json  ──load──▶  tabDocType / tabDocField / tabDocPerm  (metadata)
                                   │
                                   ├─ SchemaSyncService ──▶  tab<DocType>  (physical table, real columns)
                                   ├─ DocumentService   ──▶  generic CRUD REST API
                                   ├─ ValidationService ──▶  zod validation from field metadata
                                   ├─ PermissionService ──▶  role-based access per DocType
                                   └─ MetaController    ──▶  metadata for the dynamic UI
```

- **Definition** — each module ships version-controlled `*.doctype.json` files.
  On boot (`DoctypeLoaderService`) they are upserted into the metadata tables and
  registered in an in-memory `DoctypeRegistryService`.
- **Physical storage** — `SchemaSyncService` reconciles each DocType into a real
  Postgres table `tab<Name>` with a column per field (Frappe's model), not a
  JSONB bag. It is **additive only** (never drops columns) and idempotent.
- **CRUD** — one `DocumentController` at `/api/resource/:doctype` serves every
  DocType. The pipeline is: resolve meta → check permission → naming → validate →
  validate links → write parent + child rows in one transaction → emit lifecycle
  event.
- **Validation** — driven entirely by field metadata via the field-type registry
  (`core/field-types`), which maps each fieldtype to a Postgres column type, a
  coercion function, and a zod validator. The same fieldtype enum is shared with
  the frontend through `@fat/shared`.
- **Permissions** — `tabDocPerm` rows grant roles rights (read/write/create/
  delete/submit/cancel/report) per DocType, with field-level `permlevel`. Mirrors
  Frappe. `Administrator`/`System Manager` bypass.
- **Naming** — `hash`, `prompt`, `field:<f>`, or `series:<PATTERN>` (atomic
  counter in `tabSeries`, e.g. `SO-00001`).
- **Submit/cancel** — submittable DocTypes use `docstatus` (0 draft / 1 submitted
  / 2 cancelled); submitted documents are immutable.

## Cross-module boundaries

- **Links, not imports.** A Sales Invoice (Accounting) referencing a Customer
  (CRM) uses a Link field (`options: "Customer"`) resolved generically by the
  engine. No module imports another module's services.
- **Events, not calls.** Behavioural coupling uses `EventEmitter2` via
  `HooksService`. Example: `StockLedgerListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Stock Entry`; `GlPostingListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Sales Invoice`. Dependencies stay unidirectional.
- **Shared masters.** Company, Currency, UOM, Territory, Customer/Item Group,
  Fiscal Year live in `core-domain` so any module can link to them.

## Frontend — the dynamic "Desk"

The Next.js app has no per-DocType React code. Two generic routes —
`/app/[doctype]` (list) and `/app/[doctype]/[name]` (form) — fetch metadata from
`/api/meta/:doctype` and render:

- `DynamicListView` — columns from `in_list_view`, filters from
  `in_standard_filter`.
- `DynamicForm` — one renderer per fieldtype from a registry
  (`components/form/fields`), including a `LinkField` typeahead and a `TableField`
  child grid. Save/Submit/Cancel/Delete buttons honour the permission booleans in
  the meta payload.

## Data-access choice

TypeORM manages the **fixed** framework entities (`tabDocType`, `tabDocField`,
`tabDocPerm`, `tabSeries`, `tabRole`, `tabHasRole`, `tabUser`). The **dynamic**
`tab<DocType>` tables are managed by `SchemaSyncService` via parameterized raw
SQL / DDL over the same connection. Prisma was rejected because its static,
compile-time schema cannot express runtime-defined tables. All dynamic SQL uses
parameterized values and an allowlist of column identifiers derived from
validated metadata.

## Ledgers, reports, jobs, and row-level permissions

- **Ledgers.** On submit, Accounting posts balanced double-entry `GL Entry`
  records (debit Debtors / credit Sales) and Stock posts `Stock Ledger Entry`
  movements; both reverse on cancel. Implemented purely as event listeners
  (`gl-posting.listener.ts`, `stock-ledger.listener.ts`) — no cross-module
  service imports.
- **Reports.** `GET /api/report/:doctype` returns group-by aggregations
  (count / sum), honouring filters and row-level permissions. The frontend
  `/report/[doctype]` renders a bar breakdown; a print view lives at
  `/app/[doctype]/[name]/print`.
- **Background jobs.** `JobService` runs jobs on a BullMQ queue when `REDIS_HOST`
  is set, and inline otherwise — identical calling code either way. The
  `recompute_totals` job sums child-table line amounts into `total`/`grand_total`.
- **Row-level permissions.** `User Permission` records restrict a user to
  specific records; `DocumentService.list`/`canAccessRow` filter list results and
  block direct reads of disallowed rows.

## Phase 8 — depth, workflow, analytics, developer platform

- **Accounting/Stock depth.** Sales/Purchase tax child tables feed the
  `recompute_totals` job (net → taxes → grand_total). A `Bin` DocType holds
  per-item-per-warehouse moving-average valuation, maintained by the stock ledger
  listener; Delivery Note / Purchase Receipt / Payment Entry all post via the
  event bus. `GET /api/query-report/:name` serves Trial Balance & Stock Balance.
- **Workflow & audit.** `WorkflowService` runs role-gated state machines
  (`/api/workflow/...`) that submit/cancel documents; `VersionListener` records a
  diff on every update; Comment/File DocTypes + `POST /api/upload` (served at
  `/files`); `if_owner` perms scope reads to the owner.
- **UX & analytics.** Home dashboard (report-driven charts), `GET /api/search`
  global search, per-DocType saved filters, and a Print Format engine
  (`GET /api/print/...` renders `{{ field }}` templates).
- **Developer platform.** In-app DocType builder (`POST /api/admin/doctype` →
  live table), `Webhook` DocType + listener, API keys
  (`Authorization: token <key>:<secret>`), and an OpenAPI spec at
  `/api/openapi.json` with docs at `/api/docs`.

## Phase 9 — realism, platform, scale

- **Accounting realism.** Multi-currency (`conversion_rate` + base amounts; GL
  posts in base), tax-account split in GL (Dr Debtors / Cr Sales / Cr tax
  accounts), payment reconciliation (`Payment Entry Reference` → invoice
  outstanding + Paid/Unpaid), and per-item **FIFO** valuation (layers on `Bin`)
  alongside moving average.
- **Platform.** Real-time updates over **SSE** (`GET /api/stream` →
  `RealtimeBridge` invalidates React Query), **scheduled jobs** (`@nestjs/schedule`
  + on-demand `POST /api/admin/run-scheduled`), in-app **Notifications** (bell +
  listener + overdue sweep), and a **visual workflow designer** (`/desk/workflow`).
- **Scale.** `RegistrySyncService` keeps every instance's metadata cache coherent
  via Redis pub/sub — a DocType created on one node is picked up live by the
  others (verified with two instances), closing the multi-instance gap.

## Known limitations (still open)

- Valuation is moving-average / FIFO (no landed cost or batch/serial tracking);
  multi-currency has a single conversion rate (no revaluation).
- SSE stream is unauthenticated (payload is only doctype + name); notifications
  are in-app only (no email/SMS transport wired).
- Version stores snapshots+diffs, not a full undo; webhooks/print are best-effort.
- The DocType builder does not yet edit child-table field layouts in the UI
  (JSON/`registerDef` covers it).
