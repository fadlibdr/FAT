# FAT Architecture

FAT is an ERPNext-style ERP built as a **modular monolith** in TypeScript. This
document explains the design; see the root `README.md` for how to run it.

## Why a modular monolith

A single deployable process, but with hard internal module boundaries. Business
modules (CRM, Selling, Buying, Stock, Accounting, HR) are separate NestJS
modules that share one database and one process, yet do not import each other's
service code. Cross-module references are expressed as **data** (Link fields) and
**events**, not as compile-time dependencies. This keeps the codebase easy to
reason about and deploy, while preserving the option to split a module out later.

## The DocType engine (the core)

Everything a business module does flows through a metadata-driven engine modelled
on Frappe's DocType system.

```
*.doctype.json  ──load──▶  tabDocType / tabDocField / tabDocPerm  (metadata)
                                   │
                                   ├─ SchemaSyncService ──▶  tab<DocType>  (physical table, real columns)
                                   ├─ DocumentService   ──▶  generic CRUD REST API
                                   ├─ ValidationService ──▶  zod validation from field metadata
                                   ├─ PermissionService ──▶  role-based access per DocType
                                   └─ MetaController    ──▶  metadata for the dynamic UI
```

- **Definition** — each module ships version-controlled `*.doctype.json` files.
  On boot (`DoctypeLoaderService`) they are upserted into the metadata tables and
  registered in an in-memory `DoctypeRegistryService`.
- **Physical storage** — `SchemaSyncService` reconciles each DocType into a real
  Postgres table `tab<Name>` with a column per field (Frappe's model), not a
  JSONB bag. It is **additive only** (never drops columns) and idempotent.
- **CRUD** — one `DocumentController` at `/api/resource/:doctype` serves every
  DocType. The pipeline is: resolve meta → check permission → naming → validate →
  validate links → write parent + child rows in one transaction → emit lifecycle
  event.
- **Validation** — driven entirely by field metadata via the field-type registry
  (`core/field-types`), which maps each fieldtype to a Postgres column type, a
  coercion function, and a zod validator. The same fieldtype enum is shared with
  the frontend through `@fat/shared`.
- **Permissions** — `tabDocPerm` rows grant roles rights (read/write/create/
  delete/submit/cancel/report) per DocType, with field-level `permlevel`. Mirrors
  Frappe. `Administrator`/`System Manager` bypass.
- **Naming** — `hash`, `prompt`, `field:<f>`, or `series:<PATTERN>` (atomic
  counter in `tabSeries`, e.g. `SO-00001`).
- **Submit/cancel** — submittable DocTypes use `docstatus` (0 draft / 1 submitted
  / 2 cancelled); submitted documents are immutable.

## Cross-module boundaries

- **Links, not imports.** A Sales Invoice (Accounting) referencing a Customer
  (CRM) uses a Link field (`options: "Customer"`) resolved generically by the
  engine. No module imports another module's services.
- **Events, not calls.** Behavioural coupling uses `EventEmitter2` via
  `HooksService`. Example: `StockLedgerListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Stock Entry`; `GlPostingListener` reacts to
  `doc.on_submit:Sales Invoice`. Dependencies stay unidirectional.
- **Shared masters.** Company, Currency, UOM, Territory, Customer/Item Group,
  Fiscal Year live in `core-domain` so any module can link to them.

## Frontend — the dynamic "Desk"

The Next.js app has no per-DocType React code. Two generic routes —
`/app/[doctype]` (list) and `/app/[doctype]/[name]` (form) — fetch metadata from
`/api/meta/:doctype` and render:

- `DynamicListView` — columns from `in_list_view`, filters from
  `in_standard_filter`.
- `DynamicForm` — one renderer per fieldtype from a registry
  (`components/form/fields`), including a `LinkField` typeahead and a `TableField`
  child grid. Save/Submit/Cancel/Delete buttons honour the permission booleans in
  the meta payload.

## Data-access choice

TypeORM manages the **fixed** framework entities (`tabDocType`, `tabDocField`,
`tabDocPerm`, `tabSeries`, `tabRole`, `tabHasRole`, `tabUser`). The **dynamic**
`tab<DocType>` tables are managed by `SchemaSyncService` via parameterized raw
SQL / DDL over the same connection. Prisma was rejected because its static,
compile-time schema cannot express runtime-defined tables. All dynamic SQL uses
parameterized values and an allowlist of column identifiers derived from
validated metadata.

## Ledgers, reports, jobs, and row-level permissions

- **Ledgers.** On submit, Accounting posts balanced double-entry `GL Entry`
  records (debit Debtors / credit Sales) and Stock posts `Stock Ledger Entry`
  movements; both reverse on cancel. Implemented purely as event listeners
  (`gl-posting.listener.ts`, `stock-ledger.listener.ts`) — no cross-module
  service imports.
- **Reports.** `GET /api/report/:doctype` returns group-by aggregations
  (count / sum), honouring filters and row-level permissions. The frontend
  `/report/[doctype]` renders a bar breakdown; a print view lives at
  `/app/[doctype]/[name]/print`.
- **Background jobs.** `JobService` runs jobs on a BullMQ queue when `REDIS_HOST`
  is set, and inline otherwise — identical calling code either way. The
  `recompute_totals` job sums child-table line amounts into `total`/`grand_total`.
- **Row-level permissions.** `User Permission` records restrict a user to
  specific records; `DocumentService.list`/`canAccessRow` filter list results and
  block direct reads of disallowed rows.

## Phase 8 — depth, workflow, analytics, developer platform

- **Accounting/Stock depth.** Sales/Purchase tax child tables feed the
  `recompute_totals` job (net → taxes → grand_total). A `Bin` DocType holds
  per-item-per-warehouse moving-average valuation, maintained by the stock ledger
  listener; Delivery Note / Purchase Receipt / Payment Entry all post via the
  event bus. `GET /api/query-report/:name` serves Trial Balance & Stock Balance.
- **Workflow & audit.** `WorkflowService` runs role-gated state machines
  (`/api/workflow/...`) that submit/cancel documents; `VersionListener` records a
  diff on every update; Comment/File DocTypes + `POST /api/upload` (served at
  `/files`); `if_owner` perms scope reads to the owner.
- **UX & analytics.** Home dashboard (report-driven charts), `GET /api/search`
  global search, per-DocType saved filters, and a Print Format engine
  (`GET /api/print/...` renders `{{ field }}` templates).
- **Developer platform.** In-app DocType builder (`POST /api/admin/doctype` →
  live table), `Webhook` DocType + listener, API keys
  (`Authorization: token <key>:<secret>`), and an OpenAPI spec at
  `/api/openapi.json` with docs at `/api/docs`.

## Phase 9 — realism, platform, scale

- **Accounting realism.** Multi-currency (`conversion_rate` + base amounts; GL
  posts in base), tax-account split in GL (Dr Debtors / Cr Sales / Cr tax
  accounts), payment reconciliation (`Payment Entry Reference` → invoice
  outstanding + Paid/Unpaid), and per-item **FIFO** valuation (layers on `Bin`)
  alongside moving average.
- **Platform.** Real-time updates over **SSE** (`GET /api/stream` →
  `RealtimeBridge` invalidates React Query), **scheduled jobs** (`@nestjs/schedule`
  + on-demand `POST /api/admin/run-scheduled`), in-app **Notifications** (bell +
  listener + overdue sweep), and a **visual workflow designer** (`/desk/workflow`).
- **Scale.** `RegistrySyncService` keeps every instance's metadata cache coherent
  via Redis pub/sub — a DocType created on one node is picked up live by the
  others (verified with two instances), closing the multi-instance gap.

## Phase 10 — completeness, interop, hardening

- **Accounting completeness.** Batch tracking (`Batch` DocType + `batch_no` on
  stock movements/ledger + batch-wise stock balance), cost centers (stamped on
  GL), budgets + Budget-vs-Actual, and **Profit & Loss / Balance Sheet**
  query-reports (GL joined to `Account.account_type`).
- **Platform interop/views.** Email transport for notifications (nodemailer;
  log-only until SMTP), CSV **import/export** (`/api/resource/:doctype/export|import`),
  **Kanban** (drag between Select columns) and month **Calendar** views, and
  server-rendered **PDF** print (`/api/print/.../pdf` via the bundled Chromium).
- **Hardening.** `@nestjs/throttler` rate limiting, an audit-log **retention**
  sweep (`RETENTION_DAYS`), an **RBAC admin** UI/endpoints (`/desk/rbac`,
  `/api/admin/rbac`), and a **Playwright e2e** suite (`apps/e2e`) wired into a
  dedicated CI job that seeds + boots both apps and runs the specs.

## Phase 11 — serial/batch depth, POS, GraphQL

- **Stock depth.** Serial numbers (`Serial No` DocType; `serial_no` on stock
  movements + ledger; the stock-ledger listener creates serials Active on receipt
  and flips them Delivered on issue) and **per-batch valuation** — `Bin` is now
  keyed by `item::warehouse::batch`, so moving-average/FIFO cost is tracked per
  batch and the stock-balance report re-aggregates back to item+warehouse.
- **Period close.** `Period Closing Voucher` (submittable): the GL listener zeroes
  every income/expense balance and books the net profit/loss into the equity
  closing account (Retained Earnings) with a balanced entry, reversible on cancel.
- **Point of Sale.** `/pos` rings up a sale — one tap posts a Sales Invoice + a
  reconciled Payment Entry. It is **offline-resilient**: when offline or the server
  is unreachable the order is persisted to a localStorage queue and retried
  automatically on reconnect (invoice name is stamped before payment so a
  mid-sequence retry never duplicates the invoice).
- **GraphQL alongside REST.** One generic Apollo (code-first) schema over the
  DocType engine — `documents`/`document` queries and `saveDocument`/
  `submitDocument`/`cancelDocument`/`deleteDocument` mutations — reusing
  `DocumentService` and the same permission checks. The global JWT guard,
  `CurrentUser`, and the throttler are execution-context aware (`requestFrom()`)
  so auth applies to REST and GraphQL alike.

## Phase 12 — Manufacturing, Projects, Assets

- **Manufacturing.** `BOM` (production item + raw-material rows) and `Work Order`
  (submittable). Submitting a Work Order emits a Stock Entry with a new
  **Manufacture** purpose that issues the BOM's materials from the source
  warehouse and receives the finished good into the target warehouse at the
  rolled-up material cost per unit (via `basic_rate` on the entry line); the
  order flips to Completed and cancel reverses the whole entry.
- **Projects.** `Project`, `Task`, and a submittable `Timesheet`. Submitting a
  Timesheet computes `billable_amount = hours × rate` (billable lines only) and
  rolls hours + amount onto the Project; cancel unwinds the rollup.
- **Assets.** `Asset` (submittable) + `Depreciation Entry` (submittable). A
  Depreciation Entry auto-computes the straight-line annual charge when left
  blank (never below salvage), books **Dr Depreciation Expense / Cr Accumulated
  Depreciation** to the GL, and steps the asset's accumulated depreciation,
  current value and status; cancel reverses the GL and unwinds the asset.
- Each module is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + one event listener,
  no cross-module service imports) and surfaces automatically in the
  metadata-driven Desk sidebar, list and form views.

## Phase 13 — Payroll, Pricing, Support

- **Payroll.** `Salary Component` (Earning/Deduction + GL account),
  `Salary Structure` (earnings/deductions child tables), and a submittable
  `Salary Slip`. On submit the listener reads the structure, computes gross /
  total deduction / net pay, and posts a balanced journal — Dr each earning
  account (Σ = gross), Cr each deduction account, Cr the payable account (net);
  cancel reverses the GL.
- **Pricing rules.** A new **pre-write engine hook** (`HooksService.applyBeforeSave`,
  invoked by `DocumentService.create`/`update` before validation) lets listeners
  transform raw input. `PricingRuleListener` uses it to match each selling line
  against active `Pricing Rule`s (by item code / item group, optionally scoped to
  a customer and above a minimum qty) and set a fixed rate or apply a discount %;
  the recompute-totals job then derives amounts/totals from the adjusted rates.
- **Support.** `Service Level Agreement` (per-priority first-response and
  resolution targets) and `Issue`. The support listener stamps `response_by` /
  `resolution_by` from the applicable SLA on creation, and on Resolved/Closed
  compares the resolution time to the deadline to mark the agreement
  Fulfilled/Failed (direct SQL write-backs avoid event re-entry).
- Each module is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + one event listener, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk sidebar,
  list and form views.

## Phase 14 — CRM pipeline, Subscriptions, Loyalty

- **CRM pipeline.** `Lead` and `Opportunity` gain conversion behaviour: marking a
  Lead "Converted" creates a `Customer` (once) and links it back; marking an
  Opportunity "Converted" builds a draft `Quotation` from its items (new
  `Opportunity Item` child) and links it back. Idempotent via the stamped
  back-links. The Pricing Rule listener is now gated to billing transactions
  (those with a `grand_total` field) so pre-sales Opportunities are not priced
  and the converted Quotation is discounted exactly once.
- **Subscriptions.** `Subscription Plan` + `Subscription`. A daily cron (and
  `POST /api/admin/run-subscriptions`, with an optional `as_of` date) bills every
  Active subscription whose `next_invoice_date` has arrived — raising and
  submitting a Sales Invoice from the plan via the generic `DocumentService` (so
  GL posts through the normal event path), then advancing the date and recording
  the run. It waits for the async recompute-totals job before submitting so GL
  posts the real amount.
- **Loyalty.** `Loyalty Program` + a `Loyalty Point Entry` ledger. Submitting a
  Sales Invoice earns `floor(grand_total × collection_factor)` points under the
  default active program (Accrual entry), reversed when the invoice is cancelled;
  redemptions are negative entries and the balance (sum of entries) is served at
  `GET /api/loyalty/balance/:customer`.
- Each is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + a listener/service, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk.

## Phase 15 — Supply-chain & inventory control

- **Stock Reconciliation.** A submittable `Stock Reconciliation` asserts absolute
  counted quantities per item+warehouse. On submit the Stock listener reads the
  current `Bin` balance and posts a Stock Ledger Entry for the *difference* only,
  reusing the shared moving-average/FIFO posting so the Bin lands exactly on the
  counted qty (and, for Opening Stock, an explicit valuation rate). It stamps
  each row's current/difference qty and the voucher's net valuation change;
  cancel reverses the same delta. No new ledger code — it rides the existing
  `post()`/`reverse()` path, so a reconciliation is just another voucher type.
- **Auto-reorder → Material Request → Purchase Order.** Items gain
  `reorder_level`/`reorder_qty`. A `ReorderService` (daily cron + `POST
  /api/buying/run-reorder`) sums on-hand qty across every Bin per reorder-enabled
  item and raises a single submitted `Material Request` (type Purchase) for the
  shortfall. `POST /api/buying/material-request/:name/make-purchase-order`
  converts a submitted request into a draft `Purchase Order`, marks the request
  Ordered, links the two, and stamps each line's ordered qty — all through the
  generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module service imports.
- **Quality Inspection.** This phase adds an awaitable **pre-submit gate** to the
  engine: `HooksService.applyBeforeSubmit` fires `doc.before_submit(:Doctype)`
  via `emitAsync` before a document transitions to submitted, and a listener that
  throws aborts the submit. The `Quality` module uses it two ways: a
  `before_save` hook derives a `Quality Inspection`'s status from its readings
  grid (Rejected if any reading fails), and a `before_submit:Purchase Receipt`
  gate (registered with `suppressErrors: false` so the thrown error propagates
  instead of being swallowed by the event emitter) blocks a receipt whose
  inspection-required items lack a submitted, Accepted inspection referencing it.
- Each is a thin `BusinessModule` (JSON DocTypes + a listener/service, no
  cross-module service imports) and appears automatically in the Desk.

## Phase 16 — HR & Payroll depth

- **Leave management.** `Leave Type` + a submittable `Leave Allocation` grant a
  balance; there is no separate ledger — balance is derived live as Σ(submitted
  allocations) − Σ(submitted applications' days) in `HrService`. A `before_save`
  hook stamps a Leave Application's inclusive day count, and the awaitable
  `before_submit` gate (added in Phase 15, and which the Leave-Approval workflow
  routes through via `setDocStatus`) blocks approval when the balance is
  insufficient — again registered with `suppressErrors: false`. Served at
  `GET /api/hr/leave-balance/:employee`.
- **Attendance & payroll proration.** An `Attendance` doctype records a status per
  employee/day. This closes a prior known limitation: the Payroll listener now
  computes a payment factor for a Salary Slip's period — Σ(attendance days, where
  Present/On Leave = 1 and Half Day = 0.5) ÷ `total_working_days` — and scales
  earnings by it before posting, so loss-of-pay reaches the GL. When no period or
  no attendance is recorded it defaults to full pay (factor 1), keeping existing
  slips unchanged. Payroll reads `tabAttendance` by SQL — no service import.
- **Expense Claim.** A submittable `Expense Claim` (+ `Expense Claim Detail`
  grid). On submit an HR listener books a balanced journal — Dr each line to its
  account (or a general employee-expense account) and Cr the total to the
  employee payable account — reversed on cancel, mirroring the Payroll/GL
  listeners' voucher pattern.
- Everything stays on the event bus: HR/Payroll import no other module's
  services, reading sibling tables by SQL and posting through the generic
  `DocumentService`.

## Phase 17 — Returns & landed cost

- **Sales Return / Credit Note.** A `Sales Invoice` gains `is_return` +
  `return_against`. The GL listener branches on it: a credit note debits Sales
  and tax and credits Debtors (the mirror of an invoice) using absolute amounts,
  since the return's own totals are negative, and sets a **negative outstanding**.
  No mutation of the original invoice — the customer's net receivable is simply
  the Debtors balance across both documents (verified: 225 − 100 = 125).
- **Delivery Note return.** A `Delivery Note` gains `is_return` + `return_against`.
  The stock listener posts a **positive** movement (goods back in at current
  valuation) instead of an issue; the existing `reverse()` handles cancel because
  the return's Stock Ledger Entry simply carries a positive `actual_qty`.
- **Landed Cost Voucher.** References a `Purchase Receipt` and an additional cost
  to spread across its items (by amount = qty×rate, or by qty). On submit it bumps
  each item's `Bin` `stock_value` and recomputes `valuation_rate`, recording each
  share as a **zero-quantity** Stock Ledger Entry; cancel reads those entries to
  subtract the shares back out and re-derive the rate. No new GL — Purchase
  Receipts value stock via the stock ledger, so landed cost rides the same path.
- Everything reuses the existing GL/stock voucher patterns — the returns are
  branches on `is_return`, and landed cost is another Bin-valuation voucher — so
  no cross-module service imports are added.

## Phase 18 — Accounts payable & cash management

- **Purchase Invoice.** The AP counterpart to Sales Invoice: on submit the GL
  listener debits the expense (and input-tax) accounts and credits Creditors,
  tracks `outstanding_amount`, and supports an `is_return` debit note (the mirror
  posting with a negative outstanding). Totals ride the shared `recompute_totals`
  job (items + taxes). Payment reconciliation was generalised — a single
  `reconcileInvoice(refDoctype, …)` helper moves outstanding on either a Sales or
  a Purchase Invoice, so a Pay-type Payment Entry clears bills exactly as a
  Receive clears sales invoices.
- **Payment Terms.** A `Payment Terms Template` (each term a portion % + credit
  days) drives a `before_save` listener that, for any invoice carrying a template
  and no explicit schedule, expands it into a `Payment Schedule` child — due_date
  = posting_date + credit_days, amount = portion × (net + taxes), with the final
  installment absorbing rounding so the rows sum exactly to the total. Works for
  both invoice types off the same template.
- **Bank Reconciliation.** `Bank Account` + `Bank Transaction`, and a
  `BankReconciliationService` (`POST /api/accounting/bank-reconcile`) that
  auto-matches unreconciled transactions to submitted Payment Entries by amount
  and direction (a deposit ↔ a Receive, a withdrawal ↔ a Pay), preferring an
  equal `reference_no`; each Payment Entry is consumed once, so the run is
  idempotent. (Field defaults are UI-applied, so the matcher treats a NULL
  transaction status as unreconciled.)
- All of it stays on the event bus / generic engine — no cross-module service
  imports; the reconciliation service and terms listener read sibling tables by
  SQL.

## Phase 19 — Financial reporting depth

The `/api/query-report/:name` engine gains **parameters**: a report may declare
`filters` and supply a `build(filters)` that returns parameterized SQL
(`$1, $2, …`), while static reports keep their plain `sql`. Identifiers stay
literal in the builders; only values are bound — same posture as the rest of the
engine. Five reports are added on top of the accumulated GL/AR/AP data:

- **AR / AP aging** (`accounts-receivable`, `accounts-payable`). Open invoices
  (submitted, positive outstanding) bucketed by age relative to an `as_of` date
  into 0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+, computed from `as_of − coalesce(due_date,
  posting_date)`. A shared `agingSql(doctype, partyField, asOf)` serves both.
- **General Ledger** (`general-ledger`). GL entries with a running balance
  (`sum(debit − credit) OVER (ORDER BY posting_date, creation ROWS …)`),
  filterable by account, party (`against`), and date range — an account
  statement when scoped to one account, a party ledger when scoped to a party.
- **Registers** (`sales-register`, `purchase-register`). Submitted invoices over a
  date range with net / tax / grand total / outstanding / status, via a shared
  `registerSql`.

Because each report reads its own source, a by-invoice AR total and the Debtors
GL control balance can legitimately differ by unallocated receipts and standalone
credit notes — the reports expose that gap rather than hiding it.

## Phase 20 — Procurement sourcing

Completes the buying cycle upstream of the Purchase Order (which already flowed
PO → Receipt → Invoice). A `SourcingService` (Buying module, no cross-module
service imports) drives it on the event bus and the generic `DocumentService`:

- **Request for Quotation.** A submittable RFQ carries an items grid and an
  invited-suppliers grid. On submit, `onRfqSubmit` creates one draft
  `Supplier Quotation` per supplier — pre-filled with the RFQ items at zero rate,
  linked via `request_for_quotation`, and stamped back onto the supplier row —
  then marks the RFQ Submitted.
- **Supplier Quotation + comparison.** Suppliers fill rates and submit (totals via
  the shared `recompute_totals` job; an on-submit hook flips the status to
  Submitted). `compare(rfq)` joins Supplier Quotation Item → Supplier Quotation,
  groups quotes per item across all *submitted* quotations for the RFQ, and flags
  the lowest — served at `GET /api/buying/rfq-comparison/:rfq`.
- **Quotation → Purchase Order.** `makePurchaseOrder(sq)` builds a draft Purchase
  Order from the chosen quotation's lines, links both, and marks the quotation
  Ordered (idempotent — a second award is rejected). Mirrors the existing
  Material-Request → Purchase-Order conversion.

## Phase 21 — Maintenance & warranty

A new `Maintenance` module (after-sales service) tied to the existing Serial No
and Customer masters, entirely on the event bus:

- **Warranty Claim.** `Serial No` gains `warranty_expiry_date`. A submittable
  `Warranty Claim`'s `before_save` hook reads the referenced serial, fills the
  item, and sets warranty status to In / Out of Warranty by comparing the serial's
  expiry to the complaint date.
- **Maintenance Schedule.** A submittable schedule whose `before_save` hook
  expands `start_date` + `periodicity` (Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly / Half-Yearly
  / Yearly) + `no_of_visits` into a `Maintenance Schedule Detail` grid of dated,
  Pending visits — the same generate-a-child-table-before-write pattern as Payment
  Terms.
- **Maintenance Visit.** On submit, the listener closes the *earliest still-pending*
  scheduled visit on the referenced schedule (FIFO) — marking it Completed and
  stamping the visit — and reopens it on cancel. Cross-document child-row update
  by SQL, no service import.

## Phase 22 — Order fulfillment & billing status

Ties the transactional documents together into order-to-cash and procure-to-pay
lifecycles, still purely on the event bus:

- **Sales Order.** Gains `per_delivered` / `per_billed` and a status. Selling's
  `FulfillmentService.recomputeSalesOrder` sums, per item, the qty on submitted
  non-return Delivery Notes and Sales Invoices that link back via `sales_order`,
  caps each at the ordered qty (Σ min(done, ordered) / Σ ordered), and derives the
  status (To Deliver and Bill / To Bill / To Deliver / Completed). A listener
  recomputes on order submit and on any linked Delivery Note / Sales Invoice
  submit **or cancel**, so progress reverses correctly.
- **Purchase Order.** The buying-side mirror (`PoFulfillmentService`), driven by
  linked Purchase Receipts / Purchase Invoices. The per-item qty helper skips the
  `is_return` filter for doctypes that don't declare it (Purchase Receipt has no
  return flag), so the same aggregation serves both sides.
- **Conversions.** `makeFromSalesOrder` / `makeFromPurchaseOrder` build a
  pre-filled **draft** Delivery Note / Sales Invoice (or Purchase Receipt /
  Invoice) from an order's lines, linked back — so submitting the draft flows
  straight into the order's fulfillment status. Exposed under `/api/selling/…`
  and `/api/buying/…`.

## Phase 23 — Item variants

Shows the DocType engine generating documents from metadata. An Item can be a
variant template (`has_variants`) carrying an `attributes` grid of the
`Item Attribute`s it varies on; each attribute owns its allowed values.

- **Generation.** `VariantService.makeVariants` loads each listed attribute's
  values, takes their cartesian product, and creates one child Item per
  combination — `item_code` suffixed by the value abbreviations, `variant_of` set,
  the base fields copied, and the specific combination stored in the variant's
  `attributes`. It checks existence first, so a re-run is idempotent and never
  trips the uniqueness guard.
- **Resolver.** `resolve(template, {attr: value, …})` scans the template's
  variants and returns the one whose attribute combination matches every pair —
  the runtime "which SKU is Medium/Blue?" lookup.
- **Guards.** A `before_save:Item` listener (suppressErrors:false) rejects an item
  that is simultaneously a template and a variant, and blocks a second variant
  with an attribute combination already used by a sibling — comparing order-
  independent signatures of the combinations.

## Phase 24 — Manufacturing shop floor

Deepens the Manufacturing module (BOM + Work Order) with routing, labour costing,
and planning — all on the existing event bus:

- **Routing & BOM costing.** `Workstation` (hour rate) and `Operation` masters,
  plus a `BOM Operation` grid on the BOM. A `before_save:BOM` hook prices each
  operation (`time_in_mins/60 × workstation hour_rate`) and sets the BOM's
  `raw_material_cost` / `operating_cost` / `total_cost` — so a BOM now carries a
  full costed bill (verified: 16 material + 30 labour = 46).
- **Job Cards & labour in valuation.** The existing Work-Order → Manufacture
  Stock Entry flow is extended: on submit it also creates a `Job Card` per
  operation (scaled to the order qty) and adds the operating cost to the
  finished-good rate, so the produced item is valued at **material + labour**
  (10 units → rate 46, `produced_value` 460). Cancel deletes the Job Cards along
  with reversing the stock entry.
- **Production Plan.** A submittable `Production Plan` whose on-submit handler
  creates a **draft** Work Order per planned item (left in draft for scheduling)
  and links it back — plan → Work Orders → (submit) → manufacture, end to end.

## Phase 25 — Sales promotions

Builds on the Pricing Rule engine (Phase 13). The `before_save` pricing listener
gains coupon gating and product (free-item) discounts; a separate promotion
listener handles usage counting and scheme generation.

- **Coupon Codes.** A `Coupon Code` points at a `coupon_based` Pricing Rule. In
  the pricing listener, a coupon-based rule is skipped unless the document's
  `coupon_code` resolves to it and the coupon is valid (within `valid_upto`, and
  `used < max_use`). Usage is tracked out-of-band: submitting a Sales Invoice
  with a coupon increments its `used` count (decremented on cancel), so a
  max-use coupon stops unlocking its rule once spent.
- **Promotional Schemes.** A submittable `Promotional Scheme` with a tier grid
  (min qty → discount %). On submit, the promotion listener deletes the rules
  previously generated for the scheme and creates one Pricing Rule per tier
  (priority = min qty, tagged `promotional_scheme`), so a single scheme drives a
  whole qty-based discount ladder; cancel removes them.
- **Free-item promotions.** A Pricing Rule's `price_or_product_discount` = Product
  (+ `free_item`/`free_qty`) makes a match append a **free line** (rate 0) rather
  than discount the matched line — buy-X-get-Y. The listener appends the free
  lines after scanning, and is idempotent (won't re-add an existing free line).
- All of it stays on the event bus / generic engine — no cross-module service
  imports.

## Phase 26 — Asset lifecycle

Extends the Assets module (Asset + Depreciation Entry) with movement, repair, and
disposal, all handled by the existing `AssetsListener` on the event bus:

- **Asset Movement.** On submit, stamps the movement's `from_location` with the
  asset's current location and updates the asset to the new location/custodian;
  cancel restores the previous location.
- **Asset Repair.** Expenses the cost (Dr Repairs Expense / Cr the payable) or
  **capitalises** it (Dr the asset account / Cr the payable, and adds the cost to
  the asset's `gross_purchase_amount` + `value_after_depreciation`). Cancel
  reverses the GL and unwinds any capitalisation.
- **Asset Disposal.** Scrap or sale. Posts the removal journal — Dr Accumulated
  Depreciation + Dr Cash (sale proceeds), Cr the fixed-asset cost — and books the
  balancing **gain (Cr) or loss (Dr)** against `sale − book value`, so the entry
  always balances (verified for loss, gain, and scrap). Marks the asset
  Scrapped/Sold and zeroes its value; cancel reverses and restores the asset's
  depreciated state.

## Phase 27 — Accounts-receivable collections

A new thin `Receivables` module (one JSON DocType + one `ReceivablesListener`,
no cross-module service imports) plus a query-report, all driven by the event bus:

- **Dunning.** A `before_save` computes the interest on an overdue invoice
  (`outstanding × rate% × overdue_days / 365`); on submit the listener books it
  Dr Debtors / Cr Interest Income (balanced, verified) and marks the notice
  Unresolved, and cancel deletes the GL. Interest income realises the time value
  of an overdue receivable without touching the original invoice.
- **Credit limit.** `Customer` gains a `credit_limit`. A
  `before_submit:Sales Invoice` gate (`suppressErrors:false`, so a throw aborts
  the submit) sums the customer's open receivable from already-submitted invoices
  and blocks the transition when adding the new invoice would exceed the limit;
  an unset/zero limit is unlimited, and credit notes (`is_return`) are exempt.
- **Customer Statement.** A `customer-statement` query-report reads the receivable
  account movements for one customer straight from `tabGL Entry` (account =
  Debtors, `against` = customer) — invoices (Dr), payments (Cr) and dunning
  interest (Dr) — with a window-function **running balance**, i.e. a statement of
  account. It reuses the ledger the other listeners already post to, so no
  separate aggregation is maintained.

## Phase 28 — Warehouse operations

Three warehouse flows added to the Stock module, all reusing the existing
`StockLedgerListener.post()` valuation engine (moving-average / FIFO) so cost
tracking stays consistent — no new ledger logic:

- **Repack.** Consumes items and produces others from one warehouse. On submit it
  reads each consumed line's current Bin rate, issues it, and sums the consumed
  value; the produced lines are then received at a single rolled-up rate
  (`consumedValue / totalProducedQty`) so the produced stock value equals the
  value consumed — cost is transformed, not created (verified 10×RAW @8 → 4 units
  valued 80). Cancel reverses every Stock Ledger Entry.
- **Putaway.** Moves received stock from a staging/receiving warehouse into
  storage: each line is a warehouse-to-warehouse transfer (issue from source,
  receive into target at the source's current valuation, so value follows the
  goods). Cancel reverses.
- **Pick List.** A `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) blocks the submit
  when any location's qty exceeds the current Bin balance — you cannot pick what
  isn't on hand. A submitted pick is converted to a **draft Delivery Note** by
  `PickListService` (`POST /api/stock/pick-list/:name/make-delivery-note`), which
  links the note back onto the pick and flips it to Delivered; the actual stock
  issue happens when that Delivery Note is submitted, through the existing listener.

## Phase 29 — Customer engagement

A new thin `Engagement` module (three JSON DocTypes + one `EngagementListener`,
no cross-module service imports) plus a query-report:

- **Campaign.** A master that Leads attribute to via a new `campaign` Link field.
  The `campaign-performance` query-report groups `tabLead` by campaign, counting
  leads and — reusing the CRM pipeline's stamped `customer` back-link as the
  conversion signal — converted leads and the conversion rate. No separate
  attribution table is maintained.
- **Contract.** A submittable agreement (Customer/Supplier via a Dynamic Link).
  A `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects an end-before-start
  range; on submit the listener derives the status (Expired if the end date has
  already passed, else Active) and cancel resets it. Dates arrive as `Date`
  objects, so comparisons normalise through epoch milliseconds rather than string
  compare.
- **Appointment.** A submittable booking with a `Datetime` range. The
  `before_submit` gate rejects a non-positive duration and, with a half-open
  overlap test (`existing.start < new.end AND existing.end > new.start`), blocks a
  submit that would double-book the same assignee — adjacent, touching slots are
  allowed. Passing the gate flips the status to Scheduled.

## Phase 30 — Accounting dimensions

ERPNext-style accounting dimensions: a second axis of analysis (project) carried
on the ledger alongside the account and cost center, so the same GL can be sliced
by project.

- **Capture.** An `Accounting Dimension` master documents which dimensions exist
  (name → reference DocType → fieldname). A `project` field is added to Sales
  Invoice, Purchase Invoice, and GL Entry; the existing `GlPostingListener`
  stamps `doc.project` onto every GL line it posts (the `Line` interface carries
  it exactly like `cost_center`) — a purely additive change, `null` when unset.
- **Report.** The `general-ledger` query-report gains a `project` filter, and a
  `project-ledger` report groups the GL by project + account (debit / credit /
  net). Both read the stamped column directly, so no separate dimension store is
  maintained.
- **Budget.** `Budget` becomes dimension-aware — `cost_center` is now optional and
  a `project` may be set instead. The `project-budget-variance` report matches
  each project budget to its GL actual (Dr − Cr for that project + account), the
  same sign convention as the cost-center `budget-variance`.

## Phase 31 — Fleet management

A new thin `Fleet` module (two JSON DocTypes + one `FleetListener`, no
cross-module service imports) plus a query-report:

- **Vehicle + Vehicle Log.** A `before_save` derives the log's
  `fuel_cost = fuel_qty × fuel_rate`. On submit the listener rolls the fuel and
  service costs onto the `Vehicle` (`total_fuel_cost` / `total_service_cost`,
  accumulated with `coalesce(…,0) + …`) and advances `last_odometer` with
  `greatest(…)`; cancel subtracts the costs back out (the odometer is not rolled
  back — readings only ever move forward).
- **Odometer gate.** A `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects a log
  whose odometer is below the vehicle's current reading, keeping the reading
  monotonic.
- **Running cost.** The `vehicle-running-cost` report aggregates a vehicle's
  submitted logs — fuel, service, distance (`max − min` odometer), total cost, and
  cost per km — reading straight from `tabVehicle Log`.

## Phase 32 — Sales team & agreements

A new thin `Salesteam` module (two JSON DocTypes + one `SalesteamListener`, no
cross-module service imports), plus a `sales_person` field on Sales Invoice and a
`blanket_order` field on Sales Order:

- **Commission.** On Sales Invoice submit, if a `sales_person` is set, the listener
  reads that person's `commission_rate` and rolls `base_grand_total` into
  `total_sales` and `base_grand_total × rate%` into `total_commission` on the
  Sales Person (credit notes are skipped). Cancel reverses with the opposite sign.
  The `sales-commission` report exposes the rollups plus target attainment.
- **Blanket Order.** A customer rate/quantity agreement for one item. A
  `before_submit` gate on Sales Order (`suppressErrors:false`) sums the order's
  qty for the blanket's item and blocks the submit if `ordered_qty + thisQty`
  exceeds `total_qty`; on submit it advances `ordered_qty` (and flips the blanket
  to Completed when exhausted), and cancel rolls it back. All quantity roll-ups are
  plain SQL over the sibling table — no shared service.

## Phase 33 — Manual accounting & payment requests

Closes the manual-voucher gap in the accounting module (all inside `Accounting`,
no cross-module imports):

- **Journal Entry posting.** A `JournalListener` totals the account rows on
  `before_save`, gates the submit (`suppressErrors:false`) to require a non-zero,
  balanced entry (`Σ debit == Σ credit`), and on submit writes one GL Entry per
  row (voucher_type `Journal Entry`); cancel deletes them. Journal Entries were
  submittable before but posted nothing — now they carry double-entry weight and
  keep the trial balance balanced (verified end-to-end).
- **Payment Request.** A submittable request against a Sales/Purchase Invoice.
  `on_submit` moves it to Requested; `PaymentRequestService.makePayment`
  (`POST /api/accounting/payment-request/:name/make-payment`) creates a **draft**
  Payment Entry — Receive for a Sales Invoice, Pay for a Purchase Invoice — carrying
  the reference allocation, links it back onto the request, and marks it Paid. The
  actual reconciliation happens when that Payment Entry is submitted, through the
  existing `GlPostingListener`.
- **Journal register.** A `journal-register` query-report lists submitted journal
  entries (date, remark, total debit/credit).

## Phase 34 — Payment modes & cash management

Teaches the Payment Entry which real account it hits, all inside `Accounting`:

- **Mode of Payment.** A master mapping a mode (Cash / Bank / Cheque) to a default
  account. Payment Entry gains a `mode_of_payment`; the `GlPostingListener`'s
  payment handler resolves the cash side of the entry from that mode's account
  (Bank Transfer → Bank, Cash → Cash), falling back to the `Cash` constant when
  unset — the party control-account side (Debtors/Creditors) is unchanged, so the
  entry still balances (verified Bank and Cash routings).
- **Reference gate.** A `before_submit:Payment Entry` gate (`suppressErrors:false`)
  requires a `reference_no` whenever the mode's type is not Cash, so a cheque or
  bank transfer can always be traced to its instrument number.
- **Mode summary.** A `payment-mode-summary` report groups submitted payments by
  mode into received (Receive) / paid (Pay) / net, over `base_paid_amount`.

## Phase 35 — Shift & attendance

Adds shift scheduling and attendance depth to the HR module (two JSON DocTypes +
fields on Attendance + a `ShiftListener`, no cross-module imports):

- **Shift Type & Assignment.** A `Shift Type` carries the working window and
  expected hours; a submittable `Shift Assignment` links an employee to a shift
  over a date range and flips Active/Cancelled on submit/cancel.
- **Attendance depth.** Attendance gains `shift`, `check_in`, `check_out`,
  `working_hours`. A `before_save` (`suppressErrors:false`) computes the worked
  hours from the check window, downgrades a day shorter than half the shift's
  expected hours to Half Day, and — since field defaults are UI-applied — defaults
  the status to Present. The same handler enforces **one attendance per employee
  per date**, excluding the row itself on update.
- **Attendance summary.** An `attendance-summary` report tallies Present / Absent /
  Half Day / On Leave counts and total hours per employee over a date range.

## Phase 36 — Tax withholding (TDS)

Withholding tax on purchases, handled entirely in the accounting module's GL
listener (additive — no new posting listener, no race between writers):

- **Category + posting.** A `Tax Withholding Category` carries a rate, TDS account,
  and single-invoice threshold. A Purchase Invoice gains `apply_tds` /
  `tax_withholding_category` / `tds_amount`. Inside the existing
  `onPurchaseInvoiceSubmit`, when TDS applies and the net is at/above the
  threshold, two extra lines are appended to the **same** GL post — Dr Creditors
  and Cr the TDS account for the withheld amount — so the entry stays balanced
  while the Creditors control account nets to `grand − tds`; the invoice's
  `outstanding_amount` is set to `grand − tds` in the same write. Cancel already
  deletes every GL line for the voucher, TDS included.
- **Supplier default.** Suppliers carry a default `tax_withholding_category`; a
  `before_save:Purchase Invoice` fills the invoice's category (and turns on
  `apply_tds`) from the supplier when the invoice hasn't set one.
- **Report.** A `tds-payable` report totals the withheld credits per supplier.

## Phase 37 — Stock reservation & availability

Adds availability discipline to the Stock module (one JSON DocType + a
`ReservationListener`, no cross-module imports), reading the Bin balance directly:

- **Stock Reservation.** A submittable reservation earmarks quantity of an item in
  a warehouse. Its `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) computes
  availability as `on-hand − already-reserved` (excluding the reservation itself)
  and blocks over-reserving; submit/cancel flip the status.
- **Delivery gate.** A `before_submit:Delivery Note` gate blocks issuing more of an
  item than is physically on hand in the source warehouse (sales returns, which
  receive goods back, are exempt) — closing the door on silent negative stock at
  the point of delivery.
- **Projected quantity.** A `projected-qty` report joins Bin (on-hand) to submitted
  Stock Reservations (reserved) and reports `on-hand − reserved` — what is free to
  promise, which can legitimately go negative when more is reserved than is held.

## Phase 38 — Supplier scorecard & performance

Supplier performance governs purchasing, in the Buying module (one submittable
DocType + child + a `ScorecardListener`, no cross-module imports):

- **Scorecard.** A `Supplier Scorecard` holds weighted criteria rows; `before_save`
  computes `Σ weight·score / Σ weight` into `total_score` and maps it to a standing
  band (≥80 Excellent, ≥60 Good, ≥40 Average, else Poor).
- **Purchasing gate.** A `before_submit:Purchase Order` gate looks up the supplier's
  most recent submitted scorecard (via `DISTINCT ON`) and blocks the order when the
  standing is Poor — a data-driven approval control that stays out of the ledger.
- **Report.** A `supplier-scorecard` report lists each supplier's latest score and
  standing.

## Phase 39 — Contact & address book

Fills out the CRM party model (one new DocType + a field on Contact + a
`ContactListener`, no cross-module imports):

- **Address.** An `Address` DocType records postal addresses against a customer,
  with a primary flag.
- **Primary contact.** Contacts gain `is_primary`. On `after_insert`/`after_update`,
  when a primary contact is saved for a customer the listener rolls its
  email/mobile onto the `Customer` (canonical details) and demotes any other
  primary contact of that customer — enforcing one primary per party. Write-backs
  are direct SQL to avoid event re-entry.
- **Report.** A `party-contacts` report lists a customer's contacts, primary first.

## Phase 40 — Deferred revenue recognition

A self-contained deferred-revenue flow in the accounting module (two DocTypes + a
`DeferredRevenueListener` + a `DeferredRevenueService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Schedule.** `before_save` splits the total into equal monthly installments (the
  last row absorbing the rounding remainder). On submit the listener books the full
  amount Dr Receivable / Cr Deferred Revenue (a liability) and marks the schedule
  Active; cancel deletes the GL.
- **Recognition.** `DeferredRevenueService.run(asOf)` (exposed at
  `POST /api/accounting/deferred-revenue/run`) walks every Active schedule, posts
  Dr Deferred Revenue / Cr Income for each unrecognized installment due on/before
  the cutoff, flags the row, bumps the recognized total, and completes the schedule
  when fully released. Flagging rows makes the run idempotent (verified: a repeat
  run recognizes nothing).
- **Report.** A `deferred-revenue` report shows total / recognized / remaining per
  schedule. The trial balance stays balanced throughout.

## Phase 41 — Project scheduling & progress

A self-contained project-scheduling flow in the projects module (a `TaskListener`
added alongside the existing `ProjectsListener`, no cross-module imports):

- **Scheduling gate.** Task gains `exp_start_date`, `depends_on` (a Link to another
  Task), and `progress`. A `before_save:Task` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects
  a task whose end precedes its start, and — for a dependent task — a start that
  falls before the task it depends on finishes (finish-to-start). Date fields
  deserialize as `Date` objects, so comparisons normalise through epoch
  milliseconds rather than string order.
- **Progress rollup.** Project gains a read-only `percent_complete`. On task insert
  or update the listener recomputes it as the average `progress` of the project's
  tasks (verified: 40 → 70 on a second task, then 90 after editing the first).
- **Report.** A `project-progress` report shows, per project, the task count, the
  completed/open split (NULL status counts as open, since field defaults are
  UI-applied), average task progress, and the stored percent-complete.

## Phase 42 — Employee advances & settlement

A self-contained advance/expense flow in the HR module (a new `Employee Advance`
DocType + `EmployeeAdvanceListener`, plus an extension of the existing
`ExpenseClaimListener`; no cross-module imports):

- **Advance.** On submit the listener books Dr Employee Advance (an asset — the
  employee owes it back) / Cr the paid-from account (Cash/Bank) for the advance
  amount and marks it Paid. Cancel reverses the GL.
- **Settlement.** An Expense Claim may link an advance. On submit the claim still
  debits each expense line, but the credit is **split**: the part covered by the
  advance's remaining balance (`advance_amount − claimed_amount`) is credited to
  the advance account — working the receivable down rather than raising a new
  payable — and only the excess is credited to Employee Payable. The advance's
  `claimed_amount` is bumped and it flips to Claimed once fully consumed. A
  `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) blocks a claim adjusting against a
  different employee's advance or one with no balance left; cancel unwinds the
  adjustment (restoring `claimed_amount` and status). Every posting stays a
  balanced double entry (verified: a 600 claim credits the advance in full, a
  follow-up 700 claim credits 400 to the advance and 300 to the payable).
- **Report.** An `employee-advance-summary` report shows per advance the amount
  paid, claimed, and outstanding balance.

## Phase 43 — Exchange rate revaluation

A self-contained revaluation flow in the accounting module (an `Exchange Rate
Revaluation` submittable DocType + child account table + an
`ExchangeRevaluationListener`; GL posted through the generic `DocumentService`, no
cross-module imports). This closes the "single conversion rate, no revaluation"
multi-currency gap noted below.

- **Computation.** `before_save` walks the account rows and sets each row's
  `gain_loss = round(balance × (new_rate − current_rate))`, summing them into the
  header `total_gain_loss` (verified: a 1000-balance row from 1.10→1.20 yields +100,
  a 500-balance row from 1.40→1.30 yields −50, total +50).
- **Posting.** On submit the listener books, per account, the adjustment as a
  balanced pair: a positive revaluation debits the account (its base value rose) and
  credits the `Exchange Gain/Loss` P&L account; a negative one reverses. The set is
  net-zero and the trial balance stays balanced (verified: GL Σdebit − Σcredit = 0).
  Cancel deletes the voucher's GL and flips the status to Cancelled.
- **Report.** An `exchange-rate-revaluation` report lists each account's balance,
  current/new rate, and gain/loss per submitted voucher.

Simplification: the gain/loss sign convention treats every revalued account the
same way (positive delta → debit the account); it does not distinguish asset vs
liability accounts, and balances are entered on the voucher rather than derived from
live foreign-currency ledger positions.

## Phase 44 — Perpetual inventory GL

An `InventoryGlListener` in the accounting module books the accounting side of each
stock movement, keeping the Stock In Hand asset account in step with the physical
stock ledger. It reads stock data (Bin valuation, Stock Ledger Entry) via SQL only —
no cross-module service imports; GL is posted through the generic `DocumentService`.

- **Receipt.** On Purchase Receipt submit it posts Dr Stock In Hand / Cr Stock
  Received But Not Billed at the received value (Σ qty × rate). Cancel deletes the
  voucher GL.
- **Issue.** On Delivery Note submit it posts Dr Cost of Goods Sold / Cr Stock In
  Hand at the delivered items' current valuation; a sales return reverses the sign.
  The valuation rate is read from the Bin moving-average rate (preserved across an
  issue), falling back to the latest stock-ledger rate if a Bin has been drawn to
  zero — so the COGS is race-independent of the stock-ledger listener that reacts to
  the same event. Cancel deletes the voucher GL.
- **Reconciliation report.** An `inventory-valuation` report lists each
  item/warehouse's Bin stock value beside the running Stock In Hand GL balance
  (verified: after receiving 10 @ 100 and delivering 4, both read 600; cancelling the
  delivery restores both to 1000).

Simplification: the Stock Received But Not Billed clearing account is raised on
receipt but not cleared by the Purchase Invoice (which still books its own expense);
perpetual and periodic postings therefore coexist rather than fully interlocking.

## Phase 45 — Sales pipeline forecasting

Extends the existing `CrmListener` (no new module, no cross-module imports):

- **Probability from stage.** `before_save:Opportunity` derives the win probability
  from the sales stage (Prospecting 10 / Qualification 25 / Proposal 50 / Negotiation
  75), but only when the save carries no explicit probability — a manually entered
  value sticks, and clearing it re-derives from the (possibly changed) stage. Running
  on before_save means it acts on the fields actually being changed.
- **Terminal override.** Closed Won forces 100% and Closed Lost forces 0%, regardless
  of any entered probability — a won deal is fully weighted, a lost one drops out.
- **Weighted value.** `weighted_amount = amount × probability` is computed in
  after_insert/after_update from the *persisted* row (a partial update may omit the
  amount, and `name` is not on the before_save payload) and written back with raw SQL,
  so there is no event re-entry.
- **Report.** A `sales-pipeline` report totals count, amount, and weighted forecast
  per open stage (Closed Won/Lost excluded). Verified: Proposal 10000 → 50 % / 5000;
  a Closed Won override → 100 % / 10000; Closed Lost → 0; re-deriving Negotiation →
  75 % / 7500.

## Phase 46 — Employee loans

A self-contained loan flow in the HR module (a `Loan` submittable DocType + a
`Loan Repayment` child schedule + a `LoanListener`; GL via the generic
`DocumentService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Amortisation.** `before_save` builds the repayment schedule with equal monthly
  principal and interest charged on the reducing balance
  (`balance × rate ÷ 12`), the last instalment absorbing any rounding so the loan
  closes at exactly zero. Total interest and total payable roll up onto the header
  (verified: 12000 @ 12 % over 12 months → interest 120, 110, … 10, total interest
  780, total payable 12780, closing balance 0).
- **Disbursement.** On submit the listener books Dr Employee Loan (an asset the
  employee owes back) / Cr the disbursing account (Cash/Bank) for the principal and
  marks the loan Disbursed. Cancel deletes the voucher GL and flips to Cancelled.
- **Report.** A `loan-repayment-schedule` report lists each instalment's principal,
  interest, total payment, and outstanding-after balance per submitted loan.

## Phase 47 — Loan repayment & closure

Completes the loan lifecycle with a `Loan Repayment Entry` submittable DocType + a
`LoanRepaymentListener` (still HR, still no cross-module imports):

- **Split posting.** Each repayment carries a principal and an interest part. On submit
  the listener posts Dr the receiving account (Cash/Bank) for the total, Cr Employee
  Loan for the principal (reducing the asset), and Cr Interest Income for the interest
  — a balanced three-line entry (verified: 1000 + 120 → Dr Cash 1120 / Cr Employee Loan
  1000 / Cr Interest Income 120, Σdebit − Σcredit = 0).
- **Tracking & closure.** The loan's `repaid_principal` / `interest_paid` roll up and the
  loan flips to Closed once the principal is fully repaid. A `before_submit` gate
  (`suppressErrors:false`) blocks over-repayment (repaid + this > loan amount) and
  repaying a loan that is not Disbursed (verified: a 20000 repayment on an 11000
  outstanding is rejected). Cancel reverses the GL and unwinds the loan totals, dropping
  it back to Disbursed.
- **Report.** A `loan-outstanding` report shows per disbursed loan the amount, principal
  repaid, outstanding, and interest collected.

## Phase 48 — Batch payroll run

A `Payroll Entry` submittable DocType + a `PayrollEntryListener` orchestrate payroll at
scale, still purely over the engine (no cross-module imports — slips are created and
submitted through the generic `DocumentService`):

- **Generation.** On submit the listener selects the active employees of the entry's
  company and, for each, creates a Salary Slip stamped with the structure, period, and a
  back-link to the entry, then submits it — the existing `PayrollListener` computes that
  slip's gross/net and posts its balanced journal (verified: 6 employees → 6 slips at
  gross 6000 / deduction 900 / net 5100, all GL balanced).
- **Rollup.** The entry records employees paid and total net pay. Because the slip
  `on_submit` hook is fire-and-forget (`emit`, not `emitAsync`), the per-slip `net_pay`
  is not yet persisted when `setDocStatus` returns; the entry therefore totals the
  structure's *nominal* net (Σ earnings − Σ deductions) × employees paid, which equals
  the summed slip nets when attendance is full (verified: total 30600).
- **Cascade cancel.** Cancelling the entry cancels every slip carrying its back-link,
  reversing each slip's GL (verified: 6 slips dropped to draft, their GL removed).
- **Report.** A `payroll-register` report lists each submitted slip's gross, deduction,
  and net, filterable by payroll run.

Simplification: the entry's headline total uses the structure's nominal net; per-employee
loss-of-pay proration still applies on each individual slip and shows in the register.

## Phase 49 — End-of-service gratuity

A self-contained gratuity flow in the HR module (a `Gratuity` submittable DocType + a
`GratuityListener`; GL via the generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Computation.** `before_save` derives service years from (relieving − joining) ÷ 365.25
  and the gratuity amount = (monthly salary ÷ 30) × days-per-year × service years
  (verified: joined 2020-01-01, relieved 2026-01-01, salary 6000, 15 days/year →
  6.0 years, 18000).
- **Provision.** On submit the listener books Dr Gratuity Expense / Cr Gratuity Payable
  for the amount and marks it Submitted; cancel deletes the voucher GL and flips to
  Cancelled (verified: balanced GL, clean reversal).
- **Report.** A `gratuity-summary` report shows per submitted voucher the employee,
  service years, monthly salary, gratuity amount, and status.

## Phase 50 — Budget control

A `BudgetGateListener` in the accounting module enforces budgets at spend time (no new
DocType — the existing Budget gains an over-budget action; the gate reads GL via SQL,
no cross-module imports):

- **Action.** Budget gains `action_if_annual_budget_exceeded` (Ignore / Warn / Stop).
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Purchase Invoice` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) matches a
  Budget by the bill's expense account + cost centre, sums the cumulative actual
  (Σ GL Dr − Cr) already posted there, and compares actual + this bill to the budget.
  Stop throws and aborts the submit; Warn logs and allows; Ignore does nothing (a debit
  note is exempt). Verified: on a 1000 budget, an 800 bill posts, a following 500 bill
  is blocked (actual 800 + 500 > 1000); a Warn budget lets a 500 bill through over a 100
  limit.
- **Report.** A `budget-utilization` report shows per budget the amount, actual, remaining,
  percent used, and action.

## Phase 51 — Commission payout

Builds on the Salesteam commission accrual (which rolls `total_commission` onto each Sales
Person as invoices submit) with a settlement flow — a `Commission Payout` submittable
DocType + a `CommissionPayoutListener` (still Salesteam, no cross-module imports):

- **Payout.** On submit the listener books Dr Commission Expense / Cr Commission Payable for
  the amount and bumps the sales person's `paid_commission`.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) blocks a payout that would push
  paid above accrued (verified: on 500 accrued, a 300 payout posts, a second 300 is rejected
  as exceeding the 200 unpaid balance). Cancel reverses the GL and unwinds `paid_commission`.
- **Report.** A `commission-payable` report shows per sales person the accrued, paid, and
  outstanding commission.

## Phase 52 — Asset depreciation run

An `AssetDepreciationService` (+ an `AssetsController`) adds batch depreciation on top of the
existing per-entry posting (no cross-module imports — entries are created and submitted through
the generic `DocumentService`):

- **Run.** `POST /api/assets/depreciation/run` (body `as_of`) walks every submitted asset still
  above its salvage value and not yet depreciated for the cutoff, computes one month of
  straight-line depreciation ((gross − salvage) ÷ life ÷ 12, capped at the remaining depreciable
  base), and creates + submits a Depreciation Entry — the AssetsListener posts Dr Depreciation
  Expense / Cr Accumulated Depreciation and rolls up the asset's accumulated total. The asset's
  `last_depreciation_date` is stamped so a repeat run for the same cutoff is a no-op.
- **Report.** An `asset-depreciation-schedule` report shows per asset the gross, salvage, monthly
  charge, accumulated depreciation, current value, last run date, and status.

Verified: a 12000 / 5-year asset depreciates 200 per run (balanced GL); a repeat run for the same
month is skipped; the next month advances accumulated to 400 and current value to 11600.

## Phase 53 — Accounting period lock

An `Accounting Period` DocType + a `PeriodLockListener` prevent back-posting into closed
periods (accounting module, no cross-module imports):

- **Period.** An Accounting Period defines a date range and a `is_closed` flag.
- **Gate.** `before_submit` gates on Journal Entry, Sales Invoice, and Purchase Invoice
  (`suppressErrors:false`) reject a submit whose posting date falls inside any closed period.
  Reopening the period (clearing the flag) lets the same voucher post (verified: a 2026-07-15
  Journal Entry is blocked while July is closed, a 2026-08-15 one posts, and the July entry
  posts once the period is reopened).
- **Report.** An `accounting-period-status` report lists each period with its lock state and the
  count of GL entries already posted in its range.

## Phase 54 — Purchase three-way match

A `ThreeWayMatchListener` in the buying module enforces that received and billed quantities stay
within what was ordered (event-bus only, reads via SQL, no cross-module imports):

- **Gates.** `before_submit` on Purchase Receipt and Purchase Invoice (`suppressErrors:false`)
  sums the quantity already received / billed per item against the linked Purchase Order (from
  other *submitted* documents), adds this document's lines, and rejects the submit if any item
  would exceed the ordered quantity. Receipts/invoices not linked to a PO are unaffected.
- **Report.** A `purchase-order-status` report shows per submitted PO the order value, % received,
  % billed, and status.

Verified: on a PO for 10, a receipt of 6 posts, a further receipt of 6 is blocked (12 > 10), and a
receipt of 4 (reaching 10) posts; likewise a Purchase Invoice for 12 is blocked while one for 10
posts, after which the PO reads 100% received / 100% billed.

## Phase 55 — Sales fulfilment control

A `SoFulfillmentGateListener` in the selling module is the sell-side mirror of the purchase
three-way match (event-bus only, reads via SQL, no cross-module imports):

- **Gates.** `before_submit` on Delivery Note and Sales Invoice (`suppressErrors:false`) sum the
  quantity already delivered / billed per item against the linked Sales Order (from other
  *submitted*, non-return documents), add this document's lines, and reject the submit if any item
  would exceed the ordered quantity. Returns (`is_return`) and documents without a Sales Order are
  exempt. This composes with the existing stock-availability and quality-inspection gates.
- **Report.** A `sales-order-status` report shows per submitted Sales Order the order value,
  % delivered, % billed, and status.

Verified: on a Sales Order for 10, a delivery of 6 posts, a further delivery of 6 is blocked
(12 > 10), and a delivery of 4 posts; a Sales Invoice for 12 is blocked while one for 10 posts.
(The demo "buy 5 WIDGET-1 get 1 WIDGET-F free" pricing rule adds a free line to the order, which
the report's % delivered correctly reflects.)

## Phase 56 — Recurring journals

A `Recurring Journal` template (+ a `Recurring Journal Account` child) and a
`RecurringJournalService` (+ endpoint) automate periodic accruals/prepayments (accounting module,
posts through the generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Template.** A Recurring Journal carries a frequency (Weekly/Monthly), a next posting date, an
  enabled flag, and a set of account rows (account / debit / credit).
- **Run.** `POST /api/accounting/recurring-journal/run` (body `as_of`) posts, for each enabled
  template due on or before the cutoff, one Journal Entry per due period up to the cutoff (a
  catch-up loop) — the JournalListener validates the balance and posts the GL — then advances the
  template's next date so a repeat run is a no-op. Each entry is stamped with a back-link to its
  template.
- **Report.** A `recurring-journal-status` report lists each template's frequency, next date,
  enabled flag, and the count of Journal Entries it has posted.

Verified: a monthly template (Dr COGS 1000 / Cr Cash 1000, next 2026-07-01) posts one balanced
entry when run as-of 2026-07-15 (next → 2026-08-01); a repeat run posts nothing; a run as-of
2026-09-15 catches up two entries (Aug + Sep), advancing next to 2026-10-01 (3 entries total).

## Phase 57 — Cash reporting

Three query-reports complete the cash picture (no schema changes — read-only over GL and invoice
outstanding):

- **cash-flow-statement.** Direct method: movements on the Cash / Bank accounts, classified into
  Operating / Investing / Financing by the voucher type that moved the cash (assets/depreciation →
  Investing; loans/gratuity/commission/period-close → Financing; everything else → Operating), with
  optional from/to date filters.
- **bank-cash-summary.** Per cash/bank account, total inflow (Σ debit), outflow (Σ credit), and
  current balance.
- **cash-flow-forecast.** Forward view: open Sales-Invoice outstanding as expected inflows and open
  Purchase-Invoice outstanding as expected outflows, bucketed by how far off each due date is
  (Overdue / 0-30 / 31-60 / 60+).

Verified: after a loan disbursement (Cr Cash 5000) and recurring journals (Cr Cash 3000), the
statement shows Financing −5000 and Operating −3000; the summary shows the Cash account at −8000;
the forecast nets open receivables 1500 against payables 1000 to +500.

Cash accounts are identified by name (`Cash`, `Bank`) since the demo chart types them both as Asset.

## Phase 58 — Bad-debt write-off

A `Write Off Entry` submittable DocType + a `WriteOffListener` handle uncollectable receivables
(accounting module, GL via the generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Default & gate.** `before_save` defaults the write-off amount to the linked Sales Invoice's
  outstanding; a `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects an amount that exceeds that
  outstanding (verified: 1000 against a 0-outstanding invoice is blocked).
- **Posting.** On submit the listener books Dr Bad Debt Expense / Cr Debtors and, when a Sales
  Invoice is linked, reduces its outstanding and flips it to **Written Off** once cleared. Cancel
  deletes the voucher GL and restores the invoice's outstanding and status (verified: a 400 invoice
  writes off to 0 / Written Off with a balanced entry, and cancel restores it to 400 / Unpaid).
- **Report.** A `write-off-register` report lists submitted write-offs by customer, invoice,
  amount, account, and reason.

## Phase 59 — Sales tax templates

A `Sales Taxes Template` DocType + a `TaxTemplateListener` make invoice/order taxes reusable
(accounting module, reads the template via SQL, no cross-module imports):

- **Template.** A Sales Taxes Template holds a set of tax rows (account head, rate, description) in
  the same `Sales Taxes and Charges` child table the invoices use.
- **Application.** A `before_save` on Sales Invoice and Sales Order copies the template's rows into
  the document's `taxes` — but only when it carries none of its own, so explicit taxes still win.
  The existing recompute-totals job then computes each `tax_amount` (rate × net) and the grand
  total.
- Seeds a "Standard VAT 10%" template.

Verified: a Sales Invoice (net 400) naming the template auto-fills a VAT row and recomputes to
tax 40 / grand total 440; a Sales Order does the same.

## Phase 60 — Purchase tax templates

The buy-side mirror of Phase 59. A `Purchase Taxes Template` DocType and the same
`TaxTemplateListener` (now generalized over template + child doctype) populate purchase taxes:

- **Template.** A Purchase Taxes Template holds tax rows in the `Purchase Taxes and Charges` child
  the purchase documents use.
- **Application.** The listener's `before_save` on Purchase Invoice and Purchase Order copies the
  named template's rows into `taxes` when the document carries none of its own; recompute-totals
  then fills each `tax_amount` and the grand total.
- Seeds a "Standard Input VAT 10%" template.

Verified: a Purchase Invoice and a Purchase Order (net 400) naming the template each recompute to
tax 40 / grand total 440; an explicit tax row (25) on a document overrides the template.

## Phase 61 — Internal transfer

A `Contra Entry` submittable DocType + a `ContraEntryListener` move money between the company's own
accounts (accounting module, GL via the generic `DocumentService`, no cross-module imports):

- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects a non-positive amount or a
  from-account equal to the to-account.
- **Posting.** On submit the listener books Dr the receiving account / Cr the paying account; cancel
  deletes the voucher GL. Because both legs sit on cash/bank accounts, the transfer nets to zero in
  the cash-flow statement while moving the per-account balances in the bank/cash summary.
- **Report.** A `contra-entry-register` report lists submitted transfers.

Verified: a Cash → Bank transfer of 1000 books Dr Bank 1000 / Cr Cash 1000 (balanced) and the
bank/cash summary shows Bank +1000; a same-account transfer is blocked; cancel restores the balances.

## Phase 62 — Sales analytics

Three read-only query-reports over submitted (non-return) Sales Invoices (no schema changes):

- **top-selling-items** — quantity sold and revenue per item, ranked by revenue.
- **customer-revenue** — per customer, invoice count, total billed, and total outstanding.
- **gross-profit** — per item, revenue vs cost (sold quantity costed at the item's average Bin
  moving-average valuation), gross profit, and margin % (gross profit ÷ revenue).

Verified: with WIDGET-1 sold at revenue 1900 against an average cost of 100/unit (cost 1400), the
gross-profit report reads gross profit 500 / margin 26.3 %; customer-revenue shows Acme Inc with
1900 billed and 1500 outstanding; the free promotional line (WIDGET-F) reports zero revenue.

## Phase 63 — Inventory analytics

Three read-only query-reports over the Bin balances and Stock Ledger Entry history (no schema
changes):

- **stock-ageing** — on-hand item/warehouse balances with the date of their last stock movement and
  the age in days (relative to an `as_of` filter), surfacing stagnant stock.
- **slow-moving-items** — in-stock items ranked by days since their last *outbound* (sale) movement;
  items never sold sort to the top.
- **stock-value-by-group** — on-hand quantity and valuation aggregated per item group.

Verified: WIDGET-1 stock (95 units across two warehouses, valued 9500) shows an age of 10 days as of
2026-07-25; the Receiving balance (never sold) tops the slow-moving list; stock-value-by-group rolls
the Products group to 9500.

## Phase 64 — Quotation → Sales Order

Completes the quote-to-order step of the sales cycle. The existing `FulfillmentService` gains a
`makeSalesOrder` method and the selling controller an endpoint (no cross-module imports — everything
goes through the generic `DocumentService`):

- **Conversion.** `POST /api/selling/quotation/:name/make-sales-order` loads a *submitted* Quotation,
  creates a draft Sales Order from its items (delivery date defaulted from the quotation's valid-till),
  links the order back to the quotation, and stamps the quotation `Ordered`. It refuses an unsubmitted
  quotation or one already converted.
- **Fields.** Quotation gains a `status` (Draft / Open / Ordered / Expired) and a `sales_order`
  back-link; Sales Order gains a `quotation` link.
- **Report.** A `quotation-status` report lists submitted quotations with their status and linked order.

Verified: converting before submit is rejected; a submitted quotation (grand total 450) produces
SO-00004 with the item copied, both linked, and the quotation marked Ordered; a second conversion is
rejected as already ordered.

## Phase 65 — Purchasing analytics

Three read-only query-reports over submitted (non-return) Purchase Invoices — the buy-side complement
to the Phase 62 sales analytics (no schema changes):

- **top-purchased-items** — quantity and spend per item, ranked by spend.
- **supplier-spend** — per supplier, invoice count, total billed, and total outstanding.
- **purchase-price-trend** — per item, the average / minimum / maximum purchase rate and total qty,
  surfacing price dispersion across bills.

Verified: WIDGET-1 purchased 10 @ 100 shows spend 1000 and a flat avg/min/max rate of 100; supplier
Budget Parts Ltd rolls up to 1 invoice / 1000 spend / 1000 outstanding.

## Phase 66 — Lead → Opportunity

Completes the front of the CRM funnel. A `CrmService` + `CrmController` add an on-demand conversion
(the `CrmListener` still handles the automatic status-triggered ones); documents are created through
the generic `DocumentService`, so CRM imports no other module's services:

- **Conversion.** `POST /api/crm/lead/:name/make-opportunity` ensures the lead has a Customer (reusing
  its already-converted customer, or creating one named after the lead), opens an Opportunity against
  that customer linked back to the lead, and stamps the lead with the customer, the opportunity, and a
  Qualified status. It refuses a lead that already has an opportunity.
- **Report.** A `lead-conversion` report shows every lead with its funnel links (customer, opportunity).

With the earlier Opportunity → Quotation (CrmListener) and Quotation → Sales Order (Phase 64), the
funnel now runs Lead → Opportunity → Quotation → Sales Order, each step linked.

Verified: a fresh lead with no customer converts to a new Customer and Opportunity (both linked back,
lead marked Qualified); a second conversion is rejected as already having an opportunity.

## Phase 67 — Opportunity → Quotation

Adds the next explicit, on-demand step of the CRM funnel alongside the existing conversions, still
routed through the generic `DocumentService` (no cross-module service imports):

- **Conversion.** `POST /api/crm/opportunity/:name/make-quotation` copies the opportunity's customer and
  any Opportunity Items onto a new draft Quotation linked back to the opportunity, then stamps the
  opportunity with the quotation and advances its status to Quotation. It refuses an opportunity that
  already has a quotation. The Quotation DocType gains a read-only `opportunity` Link back-reference.
- **Report.** An `opportunity-funnel` report lists every opportunity with its status, sales stage,
  amount, weighted amount, and its source-lead and quotation links.

The funnel now runs Lead → Opportunity → Quotation → Sales Order end to end, every step created through
an explicit endpoint and linked in both directions.

Verified: an opportunity with two items converts to QTN-00002 (customer and both item lines copied,
`opportunity` back-link set); the opportunity moves to status Quotation with the quotation linked; a
second conversion is rejected; the funnel report shows the opportunity with weighted amount 4500
(7500 × 60% probability) and its quotation link.

## Phase 68 — Customer credit control on Sales Orders

Extends the existing Sales-Invoice credit gate (`ReceivablesListener`) to the order
stage, so a customer can't stack orders past their limit before any is invoiced.
Pure event-bus behaviour, no cross-module service imports:

- **Gate.** `before_submit:Sales Order` (with `suppressErrors:false` so a throw
  aborts the submit) blocks the transition when exposure exceeds
  `Customer.credit_limit` (0 / unset = no limit). Exposure = open sales-invoice
  receivable + the un-billed backlog of *other* submitted Sales Orders + this
  order's value.
- **Un-billed backlog.** `unbilledSalesOrderOf` sums Σ grand_total × (1 −
  per_billed/100) over the customer's submitted Sales Orders — committed orders
  consume credit even before they turn into a receivable.
- **Order value at gate time.** Grand total is rolled up by an async job that runs
  *after* submit, so it is still unset in the `before_submit` payload; the gate
  values the current order from its own line items (Σ qty × rate) instead.
- **Report.** A `customer-credit-exposure` report lists each customer with a limit,
  their open receivable, un-billed order backlog, total exposure, and the headroom
  left (negative = over limit).

Verified: with a 5000 limit, a first 3000 order submits (exposure 3000); a second
3000 order is rejected (receivable 0 + unbilled 3000 + this 3000 = 6000 > 5000);
the exposure report shows limit 5000, unbilled 3000, exposure 3000, available 2000.

## Phase 69 — Blanket Order → Sales Order release

Adds the draw-down step for framework agreements. The `SalesteamListener` already
gates a Sales Order against its Blanket Order's remaining quantity and rolls
`ordered_qty` on submit/cancel; this phase adds an explicit release endpoint and a
status report. A new `SalesteamService` + `SalesteamController` create the order
through the generic `DocumentService`, so salesteam imports no other module's
services:

- **Release.** `POST /api/salesteam/blanket-order/:name/make-sales-order` (body:
  optional `qty`) creates a draft Sales Order for the blanket's customer and item,
  at the blanket rate, linked back via `blanket_order`. Quantity defaults to all
  remaining (`total_qty − ordered_qty`); a requested `qty` is honoured but capped —
  it refuses a non-submitted or fully-ordered blanket, or a qty beyond what remains.
- **Enforcement stays with the listener.** When the released order is submitted, the
  existing `before_submit` gate re-checks the remaining qty and `on_submit` rolls
  `ordered_qty` on the blanket, so release and enforcement never drift.
- **Report.** A `blanket-order-status` report lists submitted blanket orders with
  their total, ordered, and remaining quantities and status.

Verified: a 100-unit blanket releases a 30-unit Sales Order (linked, at the blanket
rate); submitting it rolls ordered_qty to 30; an 80-unit release is rejected
(exceeds remaining 70); a no-qty release draws the remaining 70; the status report
shows total 100, ordered 30, remaining 70.

## Phase 70 — Sales Order → Pick List

Adds the warehouse pick step to the outbound flow, which already runs Pick List →
Delivery Note. `PickListService` gains a generator that turns a submitted Sales
Order into a draft Pick List through the generic `DocumentService` — stock imports
no other module's services:

- **Generation.** `POST /api/stock/sales-order/:name/make-pick-list` builds a draft
  Pick List for the order's customer, one pick location per ordered line. Each
  line's warehouse is resolved to the `Bin` holding the most available stock
  (`actual_qty`) for that item; an item with no positive stock anywhere aborts the
  pick with a clear error. The Pick List links back to the sales order via a new
  read-only `sales_order` field.
- **Report.** A `pick-list-status` report lists pick lists with their total picked
  quantity and their source-order / delivery-note links.

The outbound chain now runs Sales Order → Pick List → Delivery Note end to end.

Verified: a Sales Order for 10 units picks from the warehouse stocked with 50 (over
the alternate stocked with 20), producing a linked draft Pick List of qty 10; an
order line with no stock is rejected ("No stock available to pick"); the status
report shows the pick list with total qty 10 and its sales-order link.

## Phase 71 — Material Request → Request for Quotation

Closes the front of the procurement funnel. `SourcingService` already fans a
submitted RFQ into one Supplier Quotation per invited supplier and turns a chosen
quote into a Purchase Order; this phase adds the step that raises the RFQ from a
Material Request. All through the generic `DocumentService` — buying imports no
other module's services:

- **Conversion.** `POST /api/buying/material-request/:name/make-rfq` (body:
  optional `suppliers[]`) creates a draft RFQ from a *submitted, Purchase-type*
  Material Request: it copies the requested items (item, qty, warehouse) and adds
  one RFQ Supplier row per invited supplier, linking the RFQ back via a new
  read-only `material_request` field. It refuses a non-submitted request, a
  non-Purchase type, or an empty item list.
- **Report.** A `material-request-status` report lists submitted material requests
  with their requested vs ordered quantities, status, and any linked Purchase Order.

The procurement funnel now runs Material Request → RFQ → Supplier Quotation →
Purchase Order, each step linked.

Verified: a Purchase Material Request for 15 units raises a linked RFQ carrying the
item and two invited suppliers; submitting that RFQ fans out two Supplier Quotations
(one per supplier); a Material-Transfer request is rejected ("Only a Purchase
Material Request can raise a Request for Quotation"); the status report shows the
request with total qty 15.

## Phase 72 — Delivery Note → Sales Invoice

Adds the bill-what-you-shipped step. Alongside the existing Sales Order → Delivery
Note and Sales Order → Sales Invoice conversions, `FulfillmentService` gains a
converter that raises the invoice from a delivery, through the generic
`DocumentService` — selling imports no other module's services:

- **Billing.** `POST /api/selling/delivery-note/:name/make-sales-invoice` creates a
  draft Sales Invoice from a *submitted, non-return* Delivery Note: it copies the
  delivered lines and carries the note's own `sales_order` link, so the order's
  `per_billed` recomputes as normal. The invoice links back via a new
  `delivery_note` field and the Delivery Note is stamped with a `sales_invoice`.
  It refuses a non-submitted delivery, a return, or one already billed.
- **Report.** A `delivery-billing-status` report lists submitted (non-return)
  delivery notes with their delivered value and whether each has been billed.

Verified: a Delivery Note for 12 units at rate 20 (backed by a 100-unit stock
receipt) bills to a linked Sales Invoice carrying the delivered line; the note is
stamped with the invoice; a second billing is rejected ("already billed"); the
status report shows the note with delivered value 240 and billed = Yes.

## Phase 73 — Purchase Receipt → Purchase Invoice

The buying-side mirror of Phase 72: bill what you received. Alongside the existing
Purchase Order → Receipt and Purchase Order → Invoice conversions,
`PoFulfillmentService` gains a converter that raises the bill from a receipt,
through the generic `DocumentService` — buying imports no other module's services:

- **Billing.** `POST /api/buying/purchase-receipt/:name/make-purchase-invoice`
  creates a draft Purchase Invoice from a *submitted* Purchase Receipt: it copies
  the received lines and carries the receipt's own `purchase_order` link, so the
  order's `per_billed` recomputes as normal. The invoice links back via a new
  `purchase_receipt` field and the receipt is stamped with a `purchase_invoice`.
  It refuses a non-submitted receipt or one already billed.
- **Report.** A `receipt-billing-status` report lists submitted purchase receipts
  with their received value and whether each has been billed.

Verified: a Purchase Receipt for 25 units at rate 8 bills to a linked Purchase
Invoice carrying the received line; the receipt is stamped with the invoice; a
second billing is rejected ("already billed"); the status report shows the receipt
with received value 200 and billed = Yes.

## Phase 74 — Invoice → Payment Entry

Adds the settle step to close the order-to-cash and procure-to-pay loops. The
GL-posting listener already posts a Payment Entry's cash/party GL and reconciles
its references (reducing invoice outstanding, flipping status to Paid) on submit;
this phase adds the convenience that pre-fills that Payment Entry from an invoice.
A new `PaymentService` builds the draft through the generic `DocumentService` —
accounting posts GL through events, never by importing another module:

- **Settle.** `POST /api/accounting/sales-invoice/:name/make-payment-entry`
  (Receive) and `POST /api/accounting/purchase-invoice/:name/make-payment-entry`
  (Pay) draw a draft Payment Entry for the invoice's party and open amount, with a
  single reference row allocating that amount to the invoice. The amount is the
  posted `outstanding_amount`; a *null* outstanding (the async GL post has not yet
  stamped a freshly-submitted invoice) falls back to the grand total, while an
  explicit 0 (fully settled) is rejected. Refuses a non-submitted invoice.
- **Report.** A `payment-entry-register` report lists submitted payment entries with
  the total they allocated across their referenced invoices.

Verified: a 1000 Sales Invoice settles to a draft Payment Entry (Receive, party and
1000 allocated to the invoice); submitting it drops the invoice's outstanding to 0
and its status to Paid; a second settle attempt is rejected ("nothing outstanding to
settle"); the register shows the entry with 1000 allocated.

## Phase 75 — Sales Invoice → Credit Note (Sales Return)

Adds the returns step to the sell side. The GL-posting listener already handles a
credit note (`is_return`) by mirroring the original posting; this phase adds the
converter that raises the credit note from an invoice, through the generic
`DocumentService` — selling imports no other module's services:

- **Return.** `POST /api/selling/sales-invoice/:name/make-return` creates a draft
  Credit Note against a *submitted, non-return* Sales Invoice: it mirrors the
  original lines at negative quantity, sets `is_return` and `return_against`, and
  carries the invoice's `sales_order` link. On submit the GL-posting listener
  reverses the original posting (Dr Sales / Cr Debtors) and books a negative
  outstanding. It refuses a non-submitted invoice or one that is itself a return.
- **Report.** A `credit-note-register` report lists submitted credit notes with the
  invoice each reverses, the return value, and its outstanding.

Verified: a 1000 Sales Invoice returns to a Credit Note mirroring its line at qty
−4; submitting the credit note posts Dr Sales 1000 / Cr Debtors 1000 (the exact
reverse of the sale) and a −1000 outstanding with status Return; returning a return
is rejected ("already a return"); the register shows the credit note against its
source invoice.

## Phase 76 — Purchase Invoice → Debit Note (Purchase Return)

The buying-side mirror of Phase 75. The GL-posting listener already handles a debit
note (`is_return`) by reversing the bill's posting; this phase adds the converter
that raises it from an invoice, through the generic `DocumentService` — buying
imports no other module's services:

- **Return.** `POST /api/buying/purchase-invoice/:name/make-return` creates a draft
  Debit Note against a *submitted, non-return* Purchase Invoice: it mirrors the
  original lines at negative quantity, sets `is_return` and `return_against`, and
  carries the invoice's `purchase_order` link. On submit the GL-posting listener
  reverses the original posting (Dr Creditors / Cr expense) and books a negative
  outstanding. It refuses a non-submitted invoice or one that is itself a return.
- **Report.** A `debit-note-register` report lists submitted debit notes with the
  bill each reverses, the return value, and its outstanding.

Verified: a 600 Purchase Invoice (Dr COGS 600 / Cr Creditors 600) returns to a Debit
Note mirroring its line at qty −6; submitting it posts Dr Creditors 600 / Cr COGS
600 (the exact reverse) and a −600 outstanding with status Return; returning a return
is rejected; the register shows the debit note against its source bill.

## Phase 77 — Sales Stock Return: Delivery Note → Return Delivery Note

Complements the financial credit note (Phase 75) with the physical goods return. The
stock-ledger listener already receives goods back on a return delivery
(`delta = is_return ? +qty : −qty`); this phase adds the converter that raises it
from a delivery, through the generic `DocumentService` — selling imports no other
module's services:

- **Return.** `POST /api/selling/delivery-note/:name/make-return` creates a draft
  return Delivery Note against a *submitted, non-return* delivery: it mirrors the
  shipped lines at positive quantity (same warehouses), sets `is_return` and
  `return_against`, and carries the `sales_order` link. On submit the stock-ledger
  listener receives the goods back into stock at the current valuation. It refuses a
  non-submitted delivery or one that is itself a return.
- **Report.** A `delivery-return-register` report lists submitted return deliveries
  with their source delivery and returned quantity.

Verified: 100 units on hand, a delivery issues 12 (→ 88), and its return receives 12
back (→ 100) — the Bin round-trips exactly; the return links back to the original
delivery; returning a return is rejected; the register shows the return with
returned qty 12.

## Phase 78 — Purchase Stock Return: Purchase Receipt → Return Purchase Receipt

The buying-side mirror of Phase 77, and it required an engine fix: the stock-ledger
listener's Purchase Receipt handler always received stock, ignoring `is_return`
(unlike the Delivery Note handler). Now a return receipt issues the goods back out:

- **Engine.** The Purchase Receipt doctype gains `is_return` / `return_against`
  fields, and `onPurchaseReceipt` posts `delta = is_return ? −qty : qty` at the
  current valuation — a return ships goods back to the supplier and removes them
  from stock. Because Purchase Receipt now carries `is_return`, the PO fulfilment
  recompute also correctly excludes returns from received quantity.
- **Return.** `POST /api/buying/purchase-receipt/:name/make-return` creates a draft
  return receipt against a *submitted, non-return* receipt: it mirrors the received
  lines at positive quantity (same warehouses), sets `is_return` and
  `return_against`, and carries the `purchase_order` link. Refuses a non-submitted
  receipt or one that is itself a return.
- **Report.** A `receipt-return-register` report lists submitted return receipts with
  their source receipt and returned quantity.

Verified: a receipt takes 40 units into stock (→ 40), and its return issues 40 back
out (→ 0); the return links to the original receipt; returning a return is rejected;
the register shows the return with returned qty 40.

## Phase 79 — Journal Entry reversal

Adds a one-click reversal for manual vouchers. A new `JournalService` draws the
mirror through the generic `DocumentService`; the existing `JournalListener` posts
and balances it like any other entry:

- **Reversal.** `POST /api/accounting/journal-entry/:name/make-reversal` creates a
  draft Journal Entry against a *submitted* entry with every row's debit and credit
  swapped, linked back via a new `reversal_of` field. Submitting it unwinds the
  original's GL exactly. It refuses an unsubmitted entry, one that is itself a
  reversal, or one already reversed by a live (non-cancelled) entry.
- **Report.** A `journal-entry-register` report lists submitted journal entries with
  their totals and any entry they reverse.

Verified: an entry posting Dr Cash 500 / Cr Sales 500 reverses to an entry with the
rows swapped (`reversal_of` set); submitting it nets both accounts to zero (Cash
500/500, Sales 500/500); reversing the reversal and reversing the original a second
time are both rejected; the register shows the reversal linked to its source.

## Phase 80 — Timesheet → Sales Invoice

Bills project work. The `ProjectsListener` already rolls submitted timesheets into a
project's total hours and billable amount; this phase turns a timesheet into revenue.
A new `ProjectsBillingService` builds the invoice through the generic
`DocumentService` — projects imports no other module's services:

- **Billing.** `POST /api/projects/timesheet/:name/make-sales-invoice` creates a
  draft Sales Invoice from a *submitted, billable, un-invoiced* Timesheet: the
  customer comes from the timesheet's project, and a single line bills hours ×
  billing rate against a shared `Timesheet Billing` service item (created on first
  use). The Sales Invoice links to the project; the timesheet is stamped with the
  invoice and the project's billed amount is rolled up. It refuses a non-submitted,
  non-billable, or already-billed timesheet, or a project with no customer.
- **Report.** A `timesheet-billing-status` report lists submitted billable
  timesheets with their hours, billable amount, and whether each has been invoiced.

Verified: an 8-hour timesheet at rate 150 (billable 1200) bills to a Sales Invoice
for its project's customer with a `Timesheet Billing` line of 8 × 150; the timesheet
is stamped and the project's billed amount rises to 1200; a second billing is
rejected; the status report shows the timesheet billed.

## Phase 81 — Payment Entry allocation integrity

Guards how a payment is split across the invoices it settles. A new
`PaymentAllocationListener` adds a `before_submit:Payment Entry` gate
(`suppressErrors:false`), complementing the existing reference-number gate — pure
event-bus, no cross-module service imports:

- **Gate.** On submit, every reference allocation must be positive; the total
  allocated across references may not exceed the amount paid (any excess is an
  unallocated advance, not an over-settlement); and no single allocation may exceed
  the referenced invoice's own outstanding. A pure on-account payment with no
  references is left alone.
- **Report.** An `unallocated-payments` report lists submitted payments whose paid
  amount exceeds what they allocated — the on-account advances awaiting application.

Verified against a 1000 invoice: a payment of 500 allocating 800 is rejected
(allocated exceeds paid), a payment of 2000 allocating 1500 is rejected (exceeds the
invoice's 1000 outstanding), and a payment of 1000 allocating 600 submits and shows
in the unallocated-payments report with 400 on account.

## Phase 82 — Leave → Attendance auto-marking

Extends the leave flow so an approved leave shows up in attendance and can't be
double-booked. All on the event bus in `HrListener`, no cross-module service imports:

- **Auto-mark.** `on_submit` of a Leave Application creates an `On Leave` Attendance
  row for each inclusive day of the range, linked back via a new `leave_application`
  field (skipping days that already have an attendance row); `on_cancel` deletes those
  rows. The Attendance doctype gains the `leave_application` link.
- **Overlap gate.** The existing `before_submit` balance gate now also rejects a leave
  whose date range overlaps another *submitted* leave for the same employee.
- **Report.** A `leave-balance` report shows, per employee and leave type, the
  allocated days (submitted allocations), used days (submitted applications), and
  remaining balance.

Verified: with 20 days allocated, a 3-day leave (Aug 3–5) approves and marks three
On Leave attendance rows; a leave overlapping those dates is rejected; a 91-day leave
is rejected for insufficient balance (17 available); the leave-balance report shows
allocated 20 / used 3 / balance 17; cancelling the leave removes its three attendance
rows.

## Phase 83 — Work Order material availability gate

Stops a Work Order from being launched without the stock to build it. The
`ManufacturingListener` already turns a submitted Work Order into a Manufacture
Stock Entry (consuming BOM materials, producing the finished good); this phase adds
a pre-flight check so that consumption can't drive stock negative. Pure event-bus,
no cross-module service imports:

- **Gate.** `before_submit:Work Order` (`suppressErrors:false`) explodes the BOM's raw
  materials scaled to the order quantity (`bom_item.qty × order_qty / bom.quantity`)
  and checks each against the available `Bin` quantity in the Work Order's source
  warehouse. Any shortage aborts the submit, naming the item, the quantity needed,
  and the quantity on hand. With no source warehouse the check is skipped.
- **Reports.** A `work-order-status` report lists work orders with their quantity,
  status, produced value, and manufacture stock entry; a `production-plan-status`
  report lists production plans with their planned item count, total planned quantity,
  and how many lines have a Work Order raised.

Verified: with 10 raw units on hand and a BOM needing 2 per finished unit, a Work
Order for 8 (needing 16) is rejected ("insufficient … need 16, have 10"), while a
Work Order for 4 (needing 8) submits and manufactures — the finished good is produced
(status Completed, produced value 80) and raw stock falls from 10 to 2; the
work-order-status report shows the completed order.

## Phase 84 — Maintenance Schedule → Maintenance Visit

Closes the loop on preventive maintenance. The `MaintenanceListener` already expands
a Maintenance Schedule into periodic visit slots and, on a submitted Maintenance
Visit, closes the earliest pending slot; this phase adds the convenience that raises
that visit. A new `MaintenanceService` builds it through the generic
`DocumentService` — maintenance imports no other module's services:

- **Next visit.** `POST /api/maintenance/schedule/:name/make-visit` creates a draft
  Maintenance Visit from a *submitted* schedule, pre-filled with the customer, item,
  serial number, a link back to the schedule, and the date of the earliest still-
  pending scheduled visit. It refuses a non-submitted schedule or one with no pending
  visits. Submitting the visit closes that slot via the existing listener.
- **Report.** A `maintenance-schedule-status` report lists submitted schedules with
  their total, completed, and pending visit counts.

Verified: a schedule of 3 monthly visits reports 3 pending; drawing and submitting a
visit closes the earliest slot (completed 1 / pending 2) and the next draw pre-fills
the following month's date, closing to completed 2 / pending 1.

## Phase 85 — Loyalty point redemption

Adds the spend side to loyalty. The `LoyaltyListener` already accrues points on a
submitted Sales Invoice; a customer's balance is the sum of their point entries. This
phase lets them spend it. A new `LoyaltyService` books redemptions through the generic
`DocumentService` — loyalty imports no other module's services:

- **Redeem.** `POST /api/loyalty/redeem` (body `{ customer, points }`) books a negative
  Loyalty Point Entry (`entry_type` Redemption) so the balance drops by the points
  spent, and returns the new balance. It refuses a non-positive amount or one greater
  than the current balance.
- **Report.** A `loyalty-balance` report lists each customer's points earned (positive
  entries), redeemed (negatives), and net balance.

Verified: a customer with 150 accrued points redeems 60 (balance → 90); attempting to
redeem 200 is rejected ("balance is 90") and redeeming 0 is rejected ("must be
positive"); the balance endpoint reads 90 and the loyalty-balance report shows earned
150, redeemed 60, balance 90.

## Phase 86 — Outbound quality inspection gate

Extends quality control to shipping. The `QualityListener` already blocks a Purchase
Receipt when a received item flagged for incoming inspection lacks an accepted
Quality Inspection; this phase mirrors that on the way out. Pure event-bus, no
cross-module service imports:

- **Gate.** A shared gate now backs both `before_submit:Purchase Receipt` (keyed on
  the Item's `inspection_required_before_purchase` flag) and a new
  `before_submit:Delivery Note` (keyed on a new `inspection_required_before_delivery`
  flag). Any line item whose Item requires inspection must have a submitted, Accepted
  Quality Inspection referencing this document, or the submit is blocked. Return
  deliveries are exempt.
- **Report.** A `quality-inspection-status` report lists submitted inspections with
  their referenced document, item, and accept/reject status.

Verified: an item flagged for before-delivery inspection blocks its Delivery Note
submission ("requires an accepted Quality Inspection"); after an Accepted Quality
Inspection referencing that delivery is submitted, the delivery submits; the
inspection-status report shows the outgoing inspection as Accepted.

## Phase 87 — Contract expiry sweep

Keeps contract status honest over time. The `EngagementListener` sets a Contract's
status when it is submitted, but a contract that was Active then keeps that status
past its end date. A new `EngagementService` adds a sweep, mirroring the recurring-
journal / deferred-revenue run pattern — pure SQL over the engine's tables, no
cross-module service imports:

- **Run.** `POST /api/engagement/run-contract-expiry` (System Manager; body optional
  `as_of`) flips every submitted, Active contract whose end date is before the as-of
  date (default today) to Expired, and returns the list of contracts expired.
- **Report.** A `contract-status` report lists submitted contracts with their party,
  value, dates, status, and days remaining until the end date (relative to an as-of
  filter).

Verified: a contract ending 2026-08-31 submits as Active; running the expiry sweep as
of 2026-12-31 returns it in the expired list and its status becomes Expired; the
contract-status report shows it with value 5000 and days-remaining computed from the
as-of date.

## Phase 88 — Sales Order → Work Orders (make-to-order)

Links selling to manufacturing by data: raise Work Orders to produce the
manufactured items on a customer order. A new `ManufacturingService` builds them
through the generic `DocumentService` — manufacturing imports no other module's
services:

- **Make to order.** `POST /api/manufacturing/sales-order/:name/make-work-orders`
  scans a *submitted* Sales Order and, for each ordered line whose item has a
  default active BOM, creates a draft Work Order (production item, that BOM, the
  ordered quantity) linked back via a new `sales_order` field. Lines with no BOM are
  skipped (bought or shipped from stock) and returned in a `skipped` list; the call
  is rejected only if nothing on the order is manufacturable. When each Work Order is
  later submitted, the existing material-availability gate (Phase 83) and manufacture
  posting apply as usual.
- **Report.** A `work-order-by-sales-order` report lists the Work Orders raised from
  each Sales Order with their production status.

Verified: a Sales Order with a manufactured line (5 units, item with a default BOM)
and a non-manufactured line raises a single draft Work Order for the manufactured
item — linked to the order at qty 5 with its BOM — and skips the no-BOM line; the
work-order-by-sales-order report shows the Work Order under its Sales Order.

## Phase 89 — Item Price auto-fill on order lines

Puts the existing Item Price list to work: it was defined but never read. A new
`ItemPriceListener` prices order lines on save. Pure event-bus, no cross-module
imports:

- **Auto-fill.** `before_save` on a billing transaction fills any line left without a
  rate from the current Item Price — `Standard Selling` for customer documents
  (Quotation / Sales Order / Sales Invoice), `Standard Buying` for supplier ones
  (Purchase Order / Purchase Invoice). The most recent price effective on or before
  today wins. A line that already carries a rate is never overwritten, so manual
  overrides — and the pricing-rule discounts that run after this — take precedence.
  The listener is registered ahead of the `PricingRuleListener` so the base price is
  set first.
- **Report.** An `item-price-list` report lists every item price with its price list,
  rate, and valid-from date.

Verified: with the item priced at 250 (Standard Selling) and 180 (Standard Buying), a
Sales Order line entered without a rate is filled to 250, a line entered at 300 keeps
300, and a Purchase Order line without a rate is filled to 180; the item-price-list
report shows both prices.

## Phase 90 — Manual bank reconciliation

Complements the auto-matcher with manual match / unmatch and a status view. The
`BankReconciliationService` already links Bank Transactions to Payment Entries by
amount and direction; this phase lets an accounts user override that by hand:

- **Match.** `POST /api/accounting/bank-reconcile/match` (body `{ transaction,
  payment_entry }`) links a chosen transaction to a chosen submitted Payment Entry,
  marking it Reconciled. It validates that the transaction is not already reconciled,
  the payment is submitted and not used by another transaction, and the direction
  (deposit ↔ Receive, withdrawal ↔ Pay) and amount both match.
- **Unmatch.** `POST /api/accounting/bank-reconcile/unmatch` (body `{ transaction }`)
  clears the link and returns the transaction to Unreconciled. Both endpoints are
  Accounts-only.
- **Report.** A `bank-reconciliation-status` report lists bank transactions with their
  deposit/withdrawal, status, and matched Payment Entry.

Verified: a 500 deposit is manually matched to a 500 Receive payment (transaction →
Reconciled, linked); matching a withdrawal to a Receive payment is rejected on
direction, and matching a 480 deposit to a 700 payment is rejected on amount;
unmatching the reconciled transaction returns it to Unreconciled with the link cleared,
as the status report reflects.

## Phase 91 — Serial numbers on deliveries

Extends serial tracking to the outbound flow. The stock-ledger listener already
creates Active serials on a receipt and marks them Delivered when a Stock Entry
issues them; deliveries carried no serials at all. Pure event-bus, no cross-module
imports:

- **Track.** Delivery Note Item gains a `serial_no` field. On submit, the delivery's
  line serials flow into the stock move, so each is marked Delivered (and a return
  delivery reactivates them to Active).
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Delivery Note` gate (returns exempt) verifies every
  listed serial exists, is Active, and sits in the line's warehouse — so an unknown,
  already-delivered, or wrong-warehouse serial cannot ship.
- **Report.** A `serial-no-status` report lists every tracked serial with its item,
  current warehouse, Active/Delivered status, and source voucher.

Verified: two serials received into a warehouse are Active; delivering one marks it
Delivered; a second delivery of the same serial is rejected ("is Delivered, not
Active") and delivering an unknown serial is rejected ("does not exist"); the
serial-no-status report shows one Delivered and one still Active.

## Phase 92 — Batch expiry gate on deliveries

Extends batch tracking to the outbound flow. A batched receipt already keeps a
per-batch on-hand balance in its Bin (`item::warehouse::batch`); deliveries could
name a batch but never checked its expiry or drew from the right bin. Pure
event-bus, no cross-module imports:

- **Track.** Delivery Note Item gains a `batch_no` field. On submit, the delivery's
  line batch flows into the stock move so the correct per-batch Bin is decremented
  (a return delivery credits it back), and the availability gate reads the batched
  bin instead of the empty-batch one.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Delivery Note` gate (returns exempt) rejects any line
  whose batch has an `expiry_date` on or before the posting date, so expired stock
  cannot ship. Dates are normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD` before comparison — TypeORM
  returns `date` columns as JS `Date` objects, so a naive `String(d).slice(0,10)`
  would yield weekday-prefixed text ("Thu Dec 31") whose lexicographic order is
  meaningless.
- **Report.** A `batch-expiry-status` report lists every batch with its item,
  expiry date, days-to-expiry, and an expired Yes/No flag (evaluated in SQL).

Verified: two batches received into a warehouse (one fresh, one already past its
expiry); delivering the fresh batch succeeds; delivering the expired batch is
rejected ("batch … expired 2026-06-30 (on or before 2026-07-15)"); the
batch-expiry-status report flags the past-dated batch Yes (days −15) and the fresh
one No (days 169).

## Phase 93 — FEFO batch auto-allocation on deliveries

Builds on the Phase 92 batch work: a Delivery Note line for a batched item no
longer needs its batch chosen by hand. Pure `before_save` listener, no
cross-module imports.

- **Auto-allocate.** For each Delivery Note line whose item `has_batch_no` and
  carries no `batch_no`, the FEFO listener looks up the item+warehouse's on-hand
  batches (from `tabBin`, `actual_qty > 0`) joined to their expiry, orders them
  nearest-expiry-first, and splits the line across them — each produced line
  carries its own batch and allocated qty. A line of 8 becomes `5×batch-A,
  3×batch-B`.
- **Skip expired.** Batches whose `expiry_date` is on or before the posting date
  are excluded from allocation entirely (null-expiry batches sort last), so FEFO
  never draws expired stock — and each split line still passes through the
  Phase 92 expiry and availability gates on submit. Any shortfall the non-expired
  batches can't cover stays on an unbatched line so the availability gate rejects
  it.
- **Report.** A `batch-wise-stock-balance` report shows on-hand qty per
  item+warehouse+batch with expiry date, days-to-expiry, and an expired Yes/No
  flag (evaluated in SQL) — the picture FEFO draws from.

Verified: three batches received (near-expiry, far-expiry, already-expired);
delivering 8 units with no batch auto-splits into 5 from the nearest-expiry batch
and 3 from the next, skipping the expired one; after submit the batch-wise balance
shows the near-expiry batch drained to 0 (dropped from the report), the far batch
at 2, and the expired batch untouched at 5.

Only Delivery Notes auto-allocate today (not Sales Invoice `update_stock` or Stock
Entry); allocation is greedy earliest-expiry with no reservation awareness.

## Phase 94 — Batch tracking on receipts + incoming expiry gate

Closes the inbound side of batch tracking: purchases could not name a batch and
nothing stopped expired stock from being booked into inventory. Pure event-bus,
no cross-module imports.

- **Track.** Purchase Receipt Item gains a `batch_no` field. On submit, the line's
  batch flows into the stock move so a batched purchase lands in the correct
  per-batch Bin (`item::warehouse::batch`), and a purchase return debits that
  batch back. Stock Entry Detail already carried `batch_no`.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Purchase Receipt` gate (returns exempt) and a
  `before_submit:Stock Entry` gate (incoming/`t_warehouse` legs only) reject any
  line whose batch has an `expiry_date` on or before the posting date, so expired
  stock cannot enter inventory. Both share the batch-expiry check and the same
  `YYYY-MM-DD` date normalization the delivery gate uses.
- **Report.** An `expiring-batches` report lists on-hand batches (`actual_qty > 0`)
  whose expiry falls within a `within_days` window (default 30) of the as-of date,
  soonest-first with days-to-expiry — a shelf-life alert distinct from the full
  batch-wise balance.

Verified: receiving a fresh and a near-expiry batch via Purchase Receipt succeeds
and both land in their per-batch bins; receiving an already-expired batch is
rejected on both Purchase Receipt and Stock Entry ("cannot receive batch … expired
2026-06-30 (on or before 2026-07-15)"); the expiring-batches report (30-day window)
lists only the near-expiry batch (17 days) and omits the far and expired ones.

## Phase 95 — Product Bundles (sales kits)

A Product Bundle sells a non-stock parent item as a kit whose components are the
things actually shipped. Pure event-bus, no cross-module imports.

- **Define.** A `Product Bundle` DocType (named by its `new_item_code` bundle
  item) holds a `Product Bundle Item` child table of component `item_code` + per-
  bundle `qty`.
- **Explode on delivery.** On Delivery Note submit, a line whose item is a bundle
  parent issues stock for each component (component qty × line qty) from the line's
  warehouse instead of the parent, so the non-stock parent never gets a Bin (a
  return credits the components back). The delivery availability gate is bundle-
  aware too: it checks each component's on-hand, not the parent, so a bundle line
  is blocked only when a component is genuinely short.
- **Report.** A `product-bundle-availability` report shows each bundle's buildable
  quantity — the min over its components of ⌊on-hand ÷ component qty⌋.

Verified: a bundle of 2×A + 1×B with 10 A and 3 B on hand reports buildable 3;
delivering 2 bundles issues 4 A and 2 B (leaving A=6, B=1, and no Bin for the
parent) and buildable drops to 1; a further 2-bundle delivery is rejected
("component … needs 2, only 1 on hand").

Bundles explode on Delivery Notes only (not Sales Invoice `update_stock`); COGS is
booked against the components' moves, and the parent line carries the sale price.

## Phase 96 — Drop shipping

Lets a supplier ship goods straight to the customer against a Sales Order, with no
own-warehouse stock movement. Pure event-bus, no cross-module imports (Buying
reads/writes sibling tables by SQL, coupling through Link fields + events).

- **Raise.** Sales Order Item gains `delivered_by_supplier` (a drop-ship flag) and
  a `supplier`. `POST /api/buying/sales-order/:name/make-drop-ship-po` groups the
  submitted order's flagged lines by supplier and creates one draft Purchase Order
  each, marked `is_drop_ship` and linked back to the order (header `sales_order`,
  per-line `against_sales_order`).
- **Fulfil.** When a drop-ship Purchase Order is submitted, the linked Sales Order
  is marked delivered — its `per_delivered` is recomputed from the qty shipped by
  all its submitted drop-ship POs over the total ordered, advancing the order to
  `To Bill` at 100%. No Delivery Note or stock ledger entry is created, because the
  goods never touch own inventory.
- **Report.** A `drop-ship-status` report lists each order's drop-ship lines with
  their supplier, the raised Purchase Order, and its status (`Not Ordered` until
  one exists).

Verified: a Sales Order with a drop-ship line (qty 6, supplier set) raises a linked
drop-ship Purchase Order; the order sits at 0% delivered / `To Deliver and Bill`;
submitting the Purchase Order moves it to 100% delivered / `To Bill`; the
drop-ship-status report shows the order line, supplier, and Purchase Order.

Billing of the drop-ship order stays on the selling side; the report keys the PO to
a line by item, so the same item drop-shipped by two suppliers is not split per PO.

## Phase 97 — Packing Slips

Breaks a submitted Delivery Note into physical cases for shipping. Pure use of the
generic DocumentService over sibling tables; no cross-module imports.

- **Pack.** A submittable `Packing Slip` DocType (Delivery Note link, from/to case
  numbers, net weight, `Packing Slip Item` lines).
  `POST /api/stock/delivery-note/:name/make-packing-slip` builds a draft slip pre-
  filled with the note's still-unpacked quantities (delivered minus already packed)
  and the next case number.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Packing Slip` gate keeps the cumulative packed qty per
  item across the note's submitted slips from exceeding what the note delivered,
  and rejects a reversed case range (`from > to`).
- **Report.** A `packing-slip-status` report shows, per delivery note + item, the
  delivered qty, packed qty, and remaining.

Verified: a Delivery Note for 10 units is packed 6 on the first slip; a slip made
from the note pre-fills the remaining 4 (case 2) and submits; a third slip for one
more unit is rejected ("packing 1 … exceeds … delivered 10, already packed 10"); the
packing-slip-status report shows delivered 10, packed 10, remaining 0.

Packing Slips are a shipping record only — they do not themselves move stock (the
Delivery Note already did) and carry no per-case weights beyond a slip total.

## Phase 98 — Shipments

Groups one or more submitted Delivery Notes into a single carrier consignment.
Pure use of the generic DocumentService over sibling tables; no cross-module
imports.

- **Consolidate.** A submittable `Shipment` DocType (carrier, AWB/tracking number,
  pickup date, computed total weight, `Shipment Delivery Note` child rows).
  `POST /api/stock/make-shipment` builds a draft shipment from a set of submitted
  notes, copying each note's customer and summing its Packing-Slip net weights into
  the shipment total.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Shipment` gate requires at least one note, each
  submitted, and none already riding on another submitted shipment.
- **Report.** A `shipment-status` report lists each shipment with its carrier,
  tracking number, delivery-note count, total weight, and status.

Verified: two Delivery Notes packed at 3 and 4 weight units consolidate into one
shipment whose total weight is 7 over 2 notes; the shipment submits; a second
shipment reusing one of the notes is rejected ("already on shipment SHIP-00001");
the shipment-status report shows the carrier, tracking, 2 notes, weight 7, and
Submitted.

Shipment weight is only as good as the Packing-Slip weights entered; there is no
carrier-rate or label integration.

## Phase 99 — Cost Center Allocation

Reallocates a "main" cost center's booked balance across several target cost
centers by percentage — the tool controllers use to spread shared overhead onto
the departments that consumed it. Pure event-bus listener; Accounting owns the GL,
so no cross-module imports.

- **Cost centers on journals.** Journal Entry Account gains a `cost_center` field,
  and the journal GL poster stamps it onto each posted GL Entry — so a manual
  journal can now carry a cost center, which is what gives a cost center a balance
  to reallocate.
- **Allocate.** A submittable `Cost Center Allocation` DocType (main cost center,
  period, `Cost Center Allocation Percentage` rows). A `before_submit` gate requires
  the percentages to sum to 100 and forbids a center allocating to itself. On
  submit, for every account the main center carries a balance on within the period,
  it posts a reclass voucher — crediting the main center and debiting the targets
  pro-rata on the same account — so the account total is unchanged but its
  cost-center split is redistributed; cancel removes the reclass.
- **Report.** A `cost-center-balance` report sums debit, credit, and net balance
  per cost center across the GL.

Verified: a journal books 1000 to a main cost center; an allocation splitting
60/40 to two targets is rejected when the percentages sum to 90, accepted at
60/40, and afterward the cost-center-balance report shows the main center at 0 and
the two targets at 600 and 400.

Allocation reclasses the period's net balance per account; it is a point-in-time
tool (re-running over an overlapping period would double-count) and does not
distribute recursively through nested cost centers.

## Phase 100 — Employee full-and-final settlement

Settles a leaving employee: encashes their unused leave, nets it with other
earnings and deductions, books the payout, and marks them Left. Pure event-bus
listener, no cross-module service imports.

- **Compute.** A submittable `Full and Final Statement` DocType (employee,
  relieving date, per-day rate, other earnings, deductions). On `before_save` it
  reads the employee's net leave balance (submitted allocations − submitted
  applications), encashes it at the per-day rate, and computes
  `net_payable = leave_encashment + other_earnings − deductions`.
- **Book.** A `before_submit` gate rejects a negative net payable; on submit it
  books **Dr Salary Expense / Cr Salaries Payable** for the net and flips the
  employee's status to **Left**; cancel reverses the GL.
- **Report.** A `final-settlement-register` report lists each statement's employee,
  relieving date, leave encashment, net payable, and status.

Verified: an employee allocated 10 leaves and having used 2 shows an 8-day balance;
at a 100/day rate the statement encashes 800 and — with 500 other earnings less 200
deductions — nets 1100; submitting posts the GL, marks the employee Left, and the
final-settlement-register shows the statement.

Leave encashment values the whole leave balance at a single supplied per-day rate
(no leave-type-specific encashment policy or salary-structure lookup); the
settlement does not itself clear the employee's outstanding advances or loans.

## Phase 101 — Opportunity won/lost close

Gives the CRM pipeline a terminal state: an Opportunity can be closed Won or Lost,
and a lost one records why. Reuses the generic DocumentService — CRM imports no
other module's services.

- **Close.** Opportunity gains a `lost_reason` field.
  `POST /api/crm/opportunity/:name/close` with `{outcome: "Won" | "Lost", reason}`
  sets a Won opportunity to status `Converted` / stage `Closed Won`, and a Lost one
  to `Lost` / `Closed Lost` with its reason recorded.
- **Guard.** Closing Lost requires a non-empty reason, and an Opportunity already
  Lost or Converted cannot be re-closed.
- **Report.** An `opportunity-loss-analysis` report groups lost opportunities by
  reason with a count and the total lost amount (reasonless losses roll up under
  "(unspecified)").

Verified: one opportunity closed Won lands at Converted / Closed Won; two closed
Lost with reasons land at Lost / Closed Lost; re-closing either a Lost or a
Converted opportunity is rejected; the opportunity-loss-analysis report shows the
two reasons with their counts and amounts (5000 and 3000).

The close is a status transition only — it does not cancel a linked Quotation or
roll the outcome up into a sales-stage forecast.

## Phase 102 — SLA breach escalation

The SupportListener marks an SLA Fulfilled or Failed when an issue is resolved, but
an issue left open past its resolution deadline stayed "Ongoing" and unseen. This
run catches those proactively. Pure SQL over the Issue table; no cross-module
service imports.

- **Escalate.** Issue gains `escalated` and `escalation_date` fields.
  `POST /api/support/escalate-overdue-issues` (System Manager, optional `as_of`)
  finds every un-resolved, still-Ongoing, not-yet-escalated issue whose
  `resolution_by` has passed, marks it `Failed`, bumps its priority one level
  (Low → Medium → High → Urgent), and stamps it escalated so a re-run is a no-op.
- **Guard.** The query coalesces a missing status to Open (API-created rows may
  carry no status) and skips Resolved/Closed and already-escalated issues, so the
  run is idempotent.
- **Report.** An `sla-breach-status` report lists the Failed / escalated issues
  with their priority, resolution deadline, and status.

Verified: an issue opened in 2020 (resolution_by 2020-01-06) is escalated when the
run is invoked as-of mid-2020 — priority Low → Medium, SLA Failed, escalated — while
a future-deadline issue is untouched; a second run escalates nothing; the
sla-breach-status report shows the escalated issue.

Escalation only raises priority and flags the breach; it does not reassign the
issue, notify an owner, or apply a business-hours calendar to the deadline.

## Phase 103 — Sales targets & achievement

Tracks a sales person's revenue goal for a period and accrues actual sales against
it as invoices are raised. Pure event-bus listener, no cross-module service
imports.

- **Target.** A submittable `Sales Target` DocType (sales person, date window,
  target amount, accrued achieved amount) with a `before_submit` gate: a positive
  target, a sales person, and a from-date not after the to-date.
- **Accrue.** On submit, each Sales Invoice for the target's sales person dated
  inside the window adds its net (Σ qty × rate, computed from the line items so it
  is deterministic at submit time rather than waiting on the async grand total) to
  the target's achieved amount; cancel reverses it, and an invoice outside the
  window or for another sales person is ignored.
- **Report.** A `sales-target-achievement` report shows each target's amount,
  achieved amount, achievement percentage, and a Met / In Progress status.

Verified: a 10 000 July target accrues two in-window invoices (4 000 + 3 000) to
7 000 while an August invoice is ignored; the report reads 70 % / In Progress; a
zero-amount target is rejected at submit.

Achievement accrues on invoice net only (no tax, and no split across multiple
overlapping targets is prevented — an invoice in two windows accrues to both).

## Phase 104 — Employee onboarding

Tracks a new hire's onboarding checklist and only lets the onboarding be signed
off once every task is done. Pure event-bus listener, no cross-module service
imports.

- **Track.** A submittable `Employee Onboarding` DocType (employee, `Onboarding
  Activity` rows each Pending/Completed). On every save a `before_save` listener
  recomputes the total, completed count, and completion percentage.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate requires at least one activity and blocks
  completing the onboarding while any activity is still Pending.
- **Report.** An `onboarding-status` report lists each onboarding's employee,
  total/completed activity counts, completion percentage, and In Progress /
  Completed status.

Verified: an onboarding with one of two activities done reads 50 % and cannot be
submitted ("1 of 2 activities still pending"); after both are marked Completed it
reads 100 % and submits; the onboarding-status report shows 2/2, 100 %, Completed.

Onboarding is a checklist only — activities carry no owner, due date, or
auto-generated follow-up task.

## Phase 105 — Quality non-conformances

Records quality defects and enforces that closing one documents what was done
about it. Pure event-bus listener, no cross-module service imports.

- **Raise.** A submittable `Non Conformance` DocType (subject, severity
  Minor/Major/Critical, a free reference type + name, reported date, corrective
  action). Draft is Open; submitted is Closed.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate blocks closing a Non Conformance without a
  recorded corrective action (and requires a subject), so every closed NCR carries
  its resolution.
- **Report.** A `non-conformance-status` report lists NCRs with severity,
  reference, and Open/Closed status, ordered Critical → Major → Minor.

Verified: a Major NCR cannot be closed until a corrective action is added
("a corrective action is required before it can be closed"), then closes; the
non-conformance-status report lists an open Critical above the closed Major.

The reference is free text (not a validated Link), and severity drives only report
ordering — there is no severity-based approval or auto-escalation.

## Phase 106 — Loan foreclosure

Lets a disbursed employee loan be settled early in one payment. Reuses the generic
DocumentService; HR imports no other module's services.

- **Foreclose.** `POST /api/hr/loan/:name/foreclose` (optional settlement date)
  computes the remaining principal (loan amount − principal already repaid),
  collects it in one entry — **Dr the disbursed-from account / Cr the loan asset**
  — marks the loan fully repaid and Closed, and tags the GL `Loan Foreclosure`.
- **Guard.** Only a **Disbursed** loan with a positive outstanding balance can be
  foreclosed; a Draft, already-Closed, or zero-balance loan is rejected.
- **Report.** A `loan-foreclosure-register` report lists foreclosed loans with the
  employee, settlement date, and settled amount (the existing `loan-outstanding`
  report then shows the loan at 0 / Closed).

Verified: a 12 000 loan with 2 000 already repaid is foreclosed for the remaining
**10 000** — the GL posts Dr Cash / Cr Employee Loan, the loan reads 0 outstanding /
Closed, and a second foreclosure is rejected ("is Closed, not Disbursed"); the
loan-foreclosure-register shows the 10 000 settlement.

Foreclosure settles principal only — it does not charge or waive any
foreclosure-date accrued interest or a prepayment penalty.

## Phase 107 — Sales Order hold

Lets a submitted Sales Order be frozen so nothing ships or bills against it — a
credit review, dispute, or stock-check pause — until it is explicitly resumed.
Pure SQL over sibling tables; Selling imports no other module's services.

- **Hold / resume.** Sales Order gains `on_hold` + `hold_reason`.
  `POST /api/selling/sales-order/:name/hold` (with a reason) and `.../resume`
  toggle the flag on a submitted order.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate on Delivery Note and Sales Invoice blocks
  fulfilling (delivering or billing) any document whose linked `sales_order` is on
  hold; a return is exempt.
- **Report.** A `sales-orders-on-hold` report lists the held orders with their
  customer, amount, and hold reason.

Verified: holding an order surfaces it on the on-hold report and makes both a
Delivery Note and a Sales Invoice against it fail ("it is on hold"); resuming the
order clears the report and lets the delivery submit.

The hold is enforced only through the linked `sales_order` on the fulfilling
document — a Delivery Note created without that link is not caught.

## Phase 108 — Timesheet approval

Puts a review step between logging billable time and invoicing it: a timesheet
must be approved before it can be billed. Reuses the generic DocumentService;
Projects imports no other module's services.

- **Approve / reject.** Timesheet gains an `approval_status` (Draft / Approved /
  Rejected). `POST /api/projects/timesheet/:name/approve` and `.../reject` set it
  on a submitted, not-yet-billed timesheet.
- **Gate.** `makeSalesInvoice` now refuses to bill a timesheet whose
  `approval_status` is not Approved, so Draft or Rejected time never reaches an
  invoice.
- **Report.** A `timesheet-approval-status` report lists submitted timesheets with
  their employee, project, hours, billable amount, approval status, and the
  invoice they were billed on.

Verified: a submitted 10-hour timesheet (billable 1000) cannot be billed while
Draft ("must be Approved before billing"); approving it lets the make-sales-invoice
call raise the invoice; the timesheet-approval-status report then shows it Approved
and billed via that invoice.

Approval is a single flat status with no approver identity, multi-level sign-off,
or link back to a rejection reason.

## Phase 109 — Purchase Order hold

The buying-side mirror of the Sales Order hold: a submitted Purchase Order can be
frozen so nothing is received or billed against it — a supplier dispute, quality
freeze, or budget review — until it is resumed. Pure SQL over sibling tables;
Buying imports no other module's services.

- **Hold / resume.** Purchase Order gains `on_hold` + `hold_reason`.
  `POST /api/buying/purchase-order/:name/hold` (with a reason) and `.../resume`
  toggle the flag on a submitted order.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit` gate on Purchase Receipt and Purchase Invoice blocks
  receiving or billing any document whose linked `purchase_order` is on hold; a
  return is exempt.
- **Report.** A `purchase-orders-on-hold` report lists the held orders with their
  supplier, amount, and hold reason.

Verified: holding an order surfaces it on the on-hold report and makes both a
Purchase Receipt and a Purchase Invoice against it fail ("it is on hold"); resuming
the order clears the report and lets the receipt submit.

As with the Sales Order hold, enforcement is through the fulfilling document's
linked `purchase_order` — a receipt created without that link is not caught.

## Phase 110 — Purchase Order short-close

Lets a partially-received Purchase Order be finalized so its un-received balance is
written off and it drops out of the open-order pipeline. Pure SQL over sibling
tables; Buying imports no other module's services.

- **Close / reopen.** Purchase Order gains an `is_closed` flag and a `Closed`
  status. `POST /api/buying/purchase-order/:name/close` marks a submitted,
  not-Completed order Closed; `.../reopen` clears the flag and recomputes status
  from its documents.
- **Sticky close.** `recomputePurchaseOrder` short-circuits on a closed order, so a
  stray Purchase Receipt or Invoice submitted afterward cannot silently reopen it —
  the order stays Closed until explicitly reopened.
- **Report.** A `purchase-order-shortfall` report lists closed orders with their
  ordered qty, received qty, and the written-off shortfall.

Verified: an order 4-of-10 received is short-closed to Closed and the shortfall
report shows ordered 10 / received 4 / shortfall 6; a further 3-unit receipt leaves
the order Closed (recompute skipped); reopening recomputes from all receipts
(7/10 → 70 %, To Receive and Bill).

Short-close is status-only — it does not itself cancel the ordered lines' remaining
quantity, so reopening restores the original demand.

## Quotation expiry (Phase 111)

Quotations carry a `valid_till` date; once past, they should not convert into
Sales Orders and should be visible as stale. Phase 111 closes that loop.

- **Expiry run.** `POST /api/selling/expire-quotations` (`FulfillmentService.
  expireQuotations(asOf?)`) selects submitted, un-ordered quotations whose
  `valid_till` is on or before `asOf` (default today) and marks them `Expired`
  in a single `UPDATE ... = ANY($1)`. Dates are normalised through an `isoDay`
  helper (UTC `YYYY-MM-DD`) so raw-SQL comparisons never see a weekday string.
- **Conversion gate.** `makeSalesOrder` throws a `BadRequestException` when the
  source quotation is already `Expired` or its `valid_till` is before the
  conversion date — an expired quotation cannot silently become an order.
- **Report.** A `quotation-expiry-status` query-report lists submitted
  quotations with their `valid_till`, `days_to_expiry` (relative to an `as_of`
  filter), and status (Expired / Ordered / open).

Verified: an expiry run as of 2026-07-16 marked QTN-00001 (valid till
2026-06-30) Expired and left QTN-00002 (2026-12-31) untouched; converting the
expired quotation was blocked ("Quotation QTN-00001 has expired (valid till
2026-06-30) and cannot be converted") while the valid one converted to SO-00003;
the report showed QTN-00001 at −16 days Expired and QTN-00002 at 168 days Ordered.

## Installation Notes (Phase 112)

Items shipped on a Delivery Note are often installed at the customer site
afterwards; Installation Notes record that step and track how much of each
delivery is still to install.

- **Make from delivery.** `POST /api/selling/delivery-note/:name/make-installation-note`
  (`InstallationService.makeInstallationNote`) drafts an Installation Note
  pre-filled with each line's outstanding-to-install quantity (delivered −
  already installed on other submitted notes). It refuses a non-submitted or
  return delivery, or one already fully installed.
- **Status roll-up.** On an Installation Note's submit (or cancel) the linked
  Delivery Note's `installation_status` is recomputed from the installed-so-far
  total: To Install → Partly Installed → Fully Installed. Like the async totals
  path this is eventually-consistent (the recompute runs on the fire-and-forget
  `on_submit` event).
- **Over-install gate.** `InstallationGateListener` aborts an Installation
  Note's submit when installed qty per item (this note plus other submitted
  notes) would exceed the Delivery Note's delivered qty.
- **Report.** An `installation-status` query-report lists, per Delivery Note +
  item, delivered vs installed vs the pending balance.

Verified: a Delivery Note of 10 drafted an Installation Note for the full 10;
submitting 12 was blocked ("installed 12 exceeds Delivery Note DN-00013
delivered 10"); a note for 6 moved the delivery to Partly Installed and a second
note for the remaining 4 to Fully Installed, after which a further note was
refused; the report showed delivered 10 / installed 10 / pending 0.

## Sales Order short-close (Phase 113)

The selling-side mirror of the Purchase Order short-close (Phase 110). When a
customer cancels the remaining balance of an order, the order can be closed so
it drops out of the open-order pipeline without cancelling the whole document.

- **Close / reopen.** `POST /api/selling/sales-order/:name/close`
  (`FulfillmentService.closeSalesOrder`) sets `is_closed` and status `Closed`;
  `.../reopen` clears the flag and recomputes status from the order's documents.
  Only a submitted, not-Completed, not-already-closed order can be closed.
- **Sticky close.** `recomputeSalesOrder` short-circuits on a closed order, so a
  stray Delivery Note or Sales Invoice cannot silently reopen it — the order
  stays Closed until explicitly reopened.
- **Enforcement.** `SalesOrderCloseGateListener` aborts a Delivery Note or Sales
  Invoice submit against a closed order (a return is exempt).
- **Report.** A `sales-order-shortfall` report lists closed orders with their
  ordered qty, delivered qty, and the written-off shortfall.

Verified: an order 4-of-10 delivered is short-closed to Closed and the shortfall
report shows ordered 10 / delivered 4 / shortfall 6; a further delivery is
blocked ("it is closed") and the order stays Closed (recompute skipped);
reopening recomputes from its documents (4/10 → 40 %, To Deliver and Bill).

Short-close is status-only — it does not itself cancel the ordered lines'
remaining quantity, so reopening restores the original demand.

## Delivery Trip (Phase 114)

A Delivery Trip dispatches an own-fleet driver + vehicle along a route of stops,
one per submitted Delivery Note. It differs from a Shipment (a carrier
consignment measured by weight/AWB) by carrying a dispatch lifecycle.

- **Build.** `POST /api/stock/make-delivery-trip` (`DeliveryTripService.
  makeFromDeliveryNotes`) drafts a trip with one stop per note (pulling each
  note's customer and a sequence number) and assigns the driver + vehicle.
- **Lifecycle.** On submit the trip becomes `Scheduled`;
  `.../dispatch` moves it to `In Transit`; `.../complete` moves it to
  `Completed` and marks every stop delivered. Each transition guards its source
  state (e.g. completing requires In Transit).
- **Uniqueness gate.** A before_submit gate rejects a stop whose Delivery Note
  is not submitted, is a return, or already rides on another submitted trip.
- **Report.** A `delivery-trip-status` report lists each trip's driver,
  vehicle, stop count, delivered-stop count, and status.

Verified: a trip over two Delivery Notes went Scheduled → In Transit → Completed
(both stops marked delivered), completing before dispatch was blocked, and a
second trip reusing one of the notes was rejected at submit ("already on trip
TRIP-00001"); the report showed 2 stops / 2 delivered / Completed.

## Subcontracting (Phase 115)

A Subcontracting Order sends raw materials to a subcontractor who returns a
finished item; Subcontracting Receipts book the finished goods back and drive
the order to completion.

- **Order + receipt.** The Subcontracting Order carries the finished item, its
  ordered qty, and a supplied-raw-materials child table.
  `POST /api/buying/subcontracting-order/:name/make-receipt`
  (`SubcontractingService.makeSubcontractingReceipt`) drafts a Subcontracting
  Receipt for the outstanding finished quantity (ordered − already received).
- **Status roll-up.** On a receipt's submit (or cancel) the order's
  `per_received` and status are recomputed (To Receive → Completed), eventually
  consistent via the fire-and-forget `on_submit` event.
- **Over-receipt gate.** A before_submit gate aborts a receipt whose qty, added
  to what's already received, would exceed the order's ordered qty.
- **Report.** A `subcontracting-status` report lists each order's finished item,
  ordered vs received qty, the pending balance, and status.

Verified: an order for 10 went To Receive on submit; a 6-unit receipt moved it
to 60 %, a second receipt of the remaining 4 to Completed (100 %); a 12-unit
receipt was blocked ("received 12 exceeds ordered 10") and a fully-received
order refused a further receipt; the report showed ordered 10 / received 10 /
pending 0 / Completed.

Subcontracting is qty/status tracking only — it does not yet post the supplied
materials' issue or the finished good's receipt to the stock ledger, nor book
subcontracting-service GL (valuation is out of scope, as for Packing Slips and
Shipments).

## Job Card execution (Phase 116)

Job Cards are created per BOM operation when a Work Order is submitted. Phase 116
gives them a shop-floor lifecycle and makes Work Order completion explicit.

- **Lifecycle.** Submitting a Work Order still produces the finished goods (the
  Manufacture stock entry) but now leaves the order `In Process` with its Job
  Cards `Open`. `POST /api/manufacturing/job-card/:name/start` moves a card to
  `Work In Progress`; `.../complete` moves it to `Completed`, recording actual
  minutes (defaulting to the planned time).
- **Finish gate.** `POST /api/manufacturing/work-order/:name/finish`
  (`JobCardService.finishWorkOrder`) marks the order `Completed`, but only once
  every one of its Job Cards is `Completed`; otherwise it reports the outstanding
  count.
- **Report.** A `job-card-status` report lists each card's operation,
  workstation, planned vs actual minutes, and status.

Verified: a Work Order for 5 (BOM with Cutting + Assembly operations) went
In Process on submit with two Open Job Cards; finishing was blocked ("has 2
incomplete Job Card(s)"); after starting and completing both cards the order
finished to Completed and a second finish was refused; the report showed both
cards Completed with planned 150 / 225 min vs actual 40.

## Material Request fulfilment (Phase 117)

A Purchase Material Request records demand; Phase 117 closes the loop to Purchase
Orders and tracks how much of each line has been ordered.

- **Raise a PO.** `POST /api/buying/material-request/:name/make-purchase-order`
  (`MaterialRequestService.makePurchaseOrder`, supplier in the body) drafts a
  Purchase Order for the request's still-outstanding lines (requested − ordered),
  linking each PO line back to the request item.
- **Fulfilment roll-up.** On a Purchase Order's submit (or cancel) each linked
  request's per-item `ordered_qty` is recomputed from all submitted POs and its
  status advances Pending → Partially Ordered → Ordered. A submitted request
  settles to Pending.
- **Stop / reopen.** `.../stop` marks a request Stopped and a before_submit gate
  blocks ordering against it; `.../reopen` clears the flag and recomputes.
- **Report.** A `material-request-fulfillment` report lists, per request item,
  requested vs ordered qty, the pending balance, and status.

Verified: a request for 10 went Pending on submit; a PO for 4 moved it to
Partially Ordered (ordered 4 / pending 6); stopping it blocked a further PO
("it is stopped") and reopening restored Partially Ordered; a PO for the
remaining 6 moved it to Ordered (10 / 0), after which a further PO was refused;
the report tracked 10 → 4 → 10 ordered throughout.

## Warranty Claim resolution (Phase 118)

A Warranty Claim records a customer complaint (with an in/out-of-warranty status
derived from the serial's expiry); Phase 118 resolves it through a Maintenance
Visit.

- **Visit from claim.** `POST /api/maintenance/warranty-claim/:name/make-visit`
  (`MaintenanceService.makeVisitFromClaim`) drafts a Maintenance Visit pre-filled
  with the claim's customer, item and serial and linked back via
  `warranty_claim`. It refuses a claim that is not Open.
- **Resolve / reopen.** Submitting a visit that links a claim marks the claim
  `Resolved` and stamps its `resolution_date`; cancelling the visit reopens the
  claim to `Open` and clears the date. (The claim's Select default isn't
  persisted on create, so the transition is keyed on `coalesce(status,'Open')`.)
- **Report.** A `warranty-claim-status` report lists claims with warranty status,
  complaint vs resolution date, days open (to resolution, or to an `as_of`
  filter while still open), and status.

Verified: a make-visit from an open claim linked it back; submitting the visit
moved the claim to Resolved with a resolution date and a second make-visit was
refused ("is not Open"); cancelling the visit reopened the claim to Open and
cleared the date; the report showed the claim Open at 15 days.

## Project & Task lifecycle (Phase 119)

Tasks already roll their progress up to a Project's `percent_complete` and honour
a date-based finish-to-start dependency. Phase 119 adds status-based completion
control and explicit project closure.

- **Task completion gate.** `POST /api/projects/task/:name/complete`
  (`ProjectService.completeTask`) marks a task Completed (progress 100) but
  refuses if the task it `depends_on` is not itself Completed — finish-to-start
  on status. The write recomputes the project's percent complete.
- **Project close gate.** `POST /api/projects/project/:name/close` marks a
  project Completed only once every task is Completed or Cancelled, reporting the
  open-task count otherwise; `.../reopen` returns it to Open.
- **Report.** A `project-task-status` report lists each project's task counts
  (total / completed / open), rolled-up percent complete, and status.

Verified: closing a project with two open tasks was blocked; completing the
dependent task before its dependency was refused ("is null" — not Completed);
after completing the dependency (project 50 %) the dependent task completed
(100 %); the project then closed to Completed, a second close was refused, and
reopening returned it to Open; the report showed 2 tasks / 2 completed / 0 open.

## Pick List picking confirmation (Phase 120)

A Pick List drawn from a Sales Order previously delivered its full ordered
quantity on submit. Phase 120 inserts a picking-confirmation step so a warehouse
records what it actually picked and short picks ship only that.

- **Confirm picking.** `POST /api/stock/pick-list/:name/confirm-picking`
  (`PickListService.confirmPicking`) records `picked_qty` per line — defaulting
  to the full to-pick qty, or a per-item subset in the body to model a short
  pick — and keeps the list `Picked`. It refuses picking more than a line's
  to-pick qty.
- **Delivery gate.** `makeDeliveryNote` now builds the Delivery Note from
  `picked_qty` (dropping zero-picked lines) and refuses a list with nothing
  picked — you must confirm picking first.
- **Report.** A `pick-list-shortfall` report lists, per line, to-pick vs picked
  qty and the shortfall.

Verified: over-picking (12 of 10) was blocked; a short pick of 7 set the line's
picked_qty and the report showed to-pick 10 / picked 7 / short 3; delivering
before confirming was refused; after confirming, the Delivery Note carried the
picked 7 and the list moved to Delivered.

## Warehouse capacity (Phase 121)

A Warehouse may declare a `max_capacity` (total units across all items); inbound
stock moves that would overflow it are blocked before submit.

- **Capacity gate.** `WarehouseCapacityListener` runs a before_submit gate on
  Putaway (per-line `to_warehouse`) and Stock Entry (per-line `t_warehouse` —
  Material Receipt / Transfer / Manufacture). For each target warehouse it sums
  the incoming quantity and, when a cap is declared, aborts if current Bin
  on-hand plus incoming would exceed it. A warehouse with no `max_capacity`
  (0 / unset) is unlimited.
- **Report.** A `warehouse-capacity` report lists capacity-limited warehouses
  with their on-hand units, remaining headroom, and utilization percentage.

Verified: receiving 8 into a cap-10 warehouse succeeded, a further 5 was blocked
("capacity 10 exceeded — on hand 8 + incoming 5"), and 2 more filled it to 10; a
putaway of 1 into the now-full warehouse was blocked while a putaway into an
uncapped warehouse succeeded; the report showed capacity 10 / on-hand 10 /
available 0 / 100 %.

Capacity is counted in raw stock units across all items (no per-item or
volumetric weighting), and reads committed Bin on-hand — the ledger updates
asynchronously, so a burst of concurrent inbound submits could momentarily
race the cap.

## Attendance regularization (Phase 122)

An Attendance Request lets an employee ask for attendance to be marked for days
they missed punching; approval writes the Attendance records.

- **Approve.** `POST /api/hr/attendance-request/:name/approve`
  (`HrService.approveAttendanceRequest`) enumerates the inclusive `from_date`…
  `to_date` span (dates normalised via `isoDay`) and creates one Attendance per
  day with the requested status (Present / Half Day), each linked back through a
  new `attendance_request` field, then marks the request Approved.
- **Overlap gate.** Approval is refused if any day in the range already has an
  Attendance for the employee, if the request is not Draft, or if the range is
  inverted. `.../reject` marks a Draft request Rejected.
- **Report.** An `attendance-request-status` report lists requests with their
  employee, day span, requested mark, and request status.

Verified: a 3-day request created three Present Attendance records and went
Approved; re-approving it was refused; a request overlapping one of those days
was blocked ("Attendance already exists … on 2026-07-03"); a fresh request was
rejected and then could not be approved; the report showed the three requests at
3 / 2 / 1 days with Approved / Draft / Rejected status.

## Bank Guarantee (Phase 123)

A Bank Guarantee (Receiving from a customer, or Providing to a supplier) is
tracked through its validity window with a claim action.

- **Lifecycle.** Submitting a guarantee makes it `Active`; a before_submit gate
  rejects an inverted validity window (end before start).
- **Expiry run.** `POST /api/accounting/bank-guarantee/expire`
  (`BankGuaranteeService.expireBankGuarantees(asOf?)`) lapses every Active
  guarantee whose `end_date` is on or before `asOf` (default today) to `Expired`.
- **Claim.** `POST /api/accounting/bank-guarantee/:name/claim` marks a
  submitted, Active, Receiving guarantee `Claimed` (the counterparty defaulted);
  it refuses a Providing guarantee, or one not Active.
- **Report.** A `bank-guarantee-status` report lists submitted guarantees with
  their `days_to_expiry` (relative to an `as_of` filter) and status.

Verified: an inverted window was blocked at submit; an expiry run as of
2026-07-16 lapsed a guarantee ending 2026-06-30 to Expired and left one ending
2026-12-31 Active; claiming the Expired guarantee was refused while the live
Receiving one became Claimed and could not be re-claimed; a Providing guarantee
refused the claim; the report showed days-to-expiry −16 Expired, 168 Claimed,
168 Active.

Bank Guarantees are tracking documents — they do not post GL (no contingent-
liability or margin-deposit entries).

## Coupon Code enforcement (Phase 124)

A Coupon Code already tracked its `used` count as invoices redeemed it; Phase 124
enforces the coupon's limits at redemption.

- **Redemption gate.** Before a Sales Invoice carrying a `coupon_code` is
  submitted, `PromotionListener.gateCoupon` refuses the coupon if it is exhausted
  (`used` has reached `max_use`, when a max is set) or lapsed (`valid_upto`
  before the invoice posting date). An unknown coupon is left to link validation.
- **Report.** A `coupon-usage` report lists coupons with their used / max /
  remaining counts, `valid_upto`, and a derived status (Active / Exhausted /
  Expired relative to an `as_of` filter).

Verified: the first invoice against a max-1 coupon redeemed it (used → 1) and a
second was blocked ("exhausted (used 1 of 1)"); an invoice against a coupon past
its valid_upto was blocked ("expired on 2026-06-30"); the report showed the two
coupons as Exhausted (1/1, remaining 0) and Expired.

## Employee Promotion (Phase 125)

An Employee Promotion applies a new designation to an employee, effective on the
promotion date.

- **Apply on submit.** `EmployeePromotionListener` snapshots the employee's
  current designation onto the promotion (`current_designation`) and writes the
  `new_designation` to the Employee record; cancelling restores the snapshot
  (only if the employee still carries the promoted designation, so a later
  promotion isn't undone).
- **Gate.** A before_submit gate requires the employee to be Active, a
  non-empty new designation, and a promotion date on or after the employee's
  joining date.
- **Report.** An `employee-promotion-register` report lists submitted promotions
  with their from → to designation change.

Verified: promoting before the joining date was blocked ("cannot be before the
joining date 2025-01-01"); a valid promotion moved the employee Engineer →
Senior Engineer and snapshotted the prior designation; the register showed the
change; cancelling reverted the employee to Engineer and marked the promotion
Cancelled.

## Shipping Rule (Phase 126)

A Shipping Rule computes a freight charge on a Sales Order from value-slab
conditions.

- **Charge computation.** On a Sales Order's save, if it carries a
  `shipping_rule`, `ShippingRuleListener` finds the condition slab that brackets
  the order's base value — total amount (Σ qty × rate) or total quantity, per the
  rule's `calculate_based_on` — and writes its `shipping_amount` to
  `shipping_charge`. No matching slab (or no rule) → zero.
- **Slab-validation gate.** On a Shipping Rule's save, a gate rejects a condition
  whose `from_value` exceeds its `to_value`, or slabs that overlap. A `to_value`
  of 0 is treated as open-ended (unbounded upper slab).
- **Report.** A `shipping-charges` report lists Sales Orders carrying a shipping
  rule with their order amount and the computed freight.

Verified: a rule with overlapping slabs was rejected ("slabs overlap near 400");
against a rule of <500→50, 500–1000→30, >1000→0, orders of 800 / 300 / 2000
computed freight 30 / 50 / 0, an order with no rule got 0, and the report
tracked each order's amount and charge.

The shipping charge is a tracked field on the Sales Order — it is not folded
into the (asynchronously recomputed) grand total, nor posted to GL.

## Employee Appraisal (Phase 127)

An Appraisal scores an employee against weighted Key Result Areas.

- **Weighted scoring.** On save, `AppraisalListener` computes each goal's
  `score_earned = weightage% × score` and the appraisal's `total_score` (Σ
  score_earned, on a 0-5 scale).
- **Scoring gate.** A before_submit gate requires at least one goal, each score
  within 0-5, and the goal weightages to sum to 100. Submitting sets the status
  Submitted (cancel → Cancelled).
- **Report.** An `appraisal-summary` report lists submitted appraisals with
  their employee, period, and weighted total score.

Verified: goals weighted 50 / 30 / 20 with scores 4 / 5 / 3 computed earned
2.0 / 1.5 / 0.6 and a total of 4.1, and submitted to Submitted; an appraisal
whose weightages summed to 90 was blocked ("must sum to 100 (got 90)") and one
with a score of 7 was blocked ("out of the 0-5 range"); the summary showed the
appraisal at 4.1.

## Employee Separation (Phase 128)

The exit counterpart to Employee Onboarding: a checklist of exit activities that,
once complete, relieves the employee.

- **Completion tracking + relieve.** `SeparationListener` keeps
  `percent_complete` current on save; a before_submit gate requires at least one
  activity and every activity Completed. Submitting sets the separation Completed
  and marks the employee's status `Left`.
- **Revert.** Cancelling the separation restores the employee to `Active` (only
  if they are still Left from this separation) and marks it Cancelled.
- **Report.** An `employee-separation-status` report lists separations with the
  employee, relieving date, activity completion, and status.

Verified: a separation with one pending activity sat at 50 % and refused submit
("1 of 2 activities still pending"); completing both moved it to 100 %,
submitting relieved the employee (status Left) and the report showed 2/2
Completed; cancelling reinstated the employee to Active.

## Purchase Receipt rejection (Phase 129)

Incoming goods can fail quality control: each Purchase Receipt line records how
many units were rejected, and only the accepted balance is taken into stock.

- **Accepted-only stock posting.** `PurchaseRejectionListener` keeps
  `accepted_qty = max(0, qty − rejected_qty)` current on save; the stock ledger
  posts only the accepted quantity into the warehouse Bin (a return still sends
  the full qty back). Received qty is the total off the truck; rejected units
  never enter on-hand stock.
- **Rejected-qty gate.** A before_submit gate blocks a submit whose rejected qty
  is negative or exceeds the received qty (returns are exempt).
- **Report.** A `purchase-receipt-rejection` report lists receipt lines with
  received, rejected, and accepted quantities.

Verified: a receipt for qty 10 with rejected 3 computed accepted 7 on the draft
and put exactly 7 into the item's Bin on submit; an over-rejection (12 of 10)
was blocked ("rejected qty 12 exceeds received qty 10"); the report showed
received 10 / rejected 3 / accepted 7.

## Leave Allocation carry-forward (Phase 130)

Leave Allocation was a passive record summed by the balance calculation. It now
carries a validated lifecycle and can roll unused leave into a new period.

- **Validation gate.** A before_submit gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects a
  negative `new_leaves_allocated`, an inverted date range, and any allocation
  whose dates overlap an existing submitted allocation for the same
  employee + leave type (preventing double-counted balances).
- **Carry-forward.** When "Add Carry-Forwarded Leaves" is ticked, before_save
  computes `carry_forwarded = min(prior unused balance, Leave Type
  max_carry_forward)` and sets `total_leaves_allocated = new + carried`. The
  balance calculations (`balanceFor`, `balances`) and the `leave-balance`
  report now sum `coalesce(total_leaves_allocated, new_leaves_allocated)`, so
  carried days count toward availability while pre-feature rows fall back to the
  plain allocation.
- **Report.** A `leave-allocation-register` report lists each allocation with
  its new / carry-forwarded / total split and submit status.

Verified: an FY2025 allocation of 10 with 3 days taken left a balance of 7; a
following FY2026 allocation of 8 with carry-forward ticked carried 5 (capped
from the 7 available by the type's max of 5) for a total of 13; the balance
report then showed allocated 23 / used 3 / balance 20. An overlapping
allocation was blocked ("overlaps existing allocation LAL-…"), as were an
inverted date range and a negative allocation.

## Quality Inspection numeric evaluation (Phase 131)

Quality Inspection already derives an overall Accepted/Rejected status from its
readings and gates Purchase Receipt / Delivery Note submission. Readings were
judged purely by a manually-set `acceptance` field; they can now be evaluated
objectively against a numeric spec range.

- **Numeric auto-acceptance.** Readings gain `min_value` / `max_value`. On save
  each reading that carries a numeric spec (a min and/or max) has its
  `acceptance` set from whether `reading_value` falls in range — a
  non-numeric reading against a numeric spec fails. Readings with no numeric
  spec keep their manual acceptance. The overall inspection status is then
  derived as before (Rejected if any reading is Rejected).
- **Validation gate.** A before_submit gate (`suppressErrors:false`) requires at
  least one reading, rejects a spec whose min exceeds its max, and rejects a
  numeric-spec reading whose value is not a number.
- **Report.** A `quality-inspection-readings` report lists every reading of each
  submitted inspection with its spec bounds, reading, and acceptance.

Verified: a reading of 15 against 10–20 auto-accepted while 25 auto-rejected
(overall Rejected), and a qualitative reading kept its manual Accepted; an
inspection with no readings, one with min 20 > max 10, and one with a
non-numeric reading against a 10–20 spec were each blocked on submit; the
readings report showed the numeric and qualitative rows with their bounds.

## Supplier bill number & duplicate gate (Phase 132)

An accounts-payable control against paying the same supplier bill twice: a
Purchase Invoice records the supplier's own invoice number, and that number must
be unique per supplier.

- **Supplier bill fields.** Purchase Invoice gains `bill_no` (the supplier's
  invoice number) and `bill_date` (its date).
- **Duplicate gate.** `SupplierBillListener` blocks a submit (before_submit,
  `suppressErrors:false`) when another submitted Purchase Invoice for the same
  supplier already carries the same `bill_no`, compared trimmed and
  case-insensitively. A debit note (`is_return`) is exempt, and an invoice with
  no bill number is unaffected.
- **Report.** A `supplier-bill-register` report lists submitted invoices with
  supplier, bill number/date, posting date, and grand total (a blank bill
  number flags an unrecorded reference).

Verified: bill "INV-A001" booked once submitted; a second invoice for the same
supplier with " inv-a001 " (different case/spacing) was blocked ("already booked
on Purchase Invoice PINV-…"); the same number under a different supplier and a
different number under the same supplier both submitted; the register listed all
three with their bill references.

## Serial warranty tracking (Phase 133)

Serial numbers carried a `warranty_expiry_date` field that nothing populated.
Delivery now stamps it from the item's warranty period, and a run keeps each
serial's warranty state current.

- **Warranty stamping on delivery.** Item gains `warranty_period_days`. When a
  Delivery Note is submitted, `SerialWarrantyService` stamps each delivered
  serial's `warranty_expiry_date` = posting date + the item's warranty period
  (only when the item has a positive period and the serial has no expiry yet). A
  return is exempt.
- **Warranty-status run.** Serial No gains a computed `warranty_status`
  (No Warranty / In Warranty / Out of Warranty). A daily cron —
  also `POST /api/stock/run-serial-warranty` with an optional `as_of` — recomputes
  it from the expiry date, and the delivery stamp refreshes it inline.
- **Report.** A `serial-warranty-status` report lists serials with their stock
  status, warranty expiry, and warranty state.

Verified: delivering a serial of an item with a 365-day warranty on 2026-07-16
stamped its expiry to 2027-07-16 and set it In Warranty, while an undelivered
serial stayed No Warranty; running the recompute as of 2028-01-01 flipped the
delivered serial to Out of Warranty; the report showed the expiry and state.

## Salary Structure Assignment (Phase 134)

Salary Slips linked a Salary Structure directly. A new time-effective assignment
ties an employee to a structure from a date, and slips follow it automatically.

- **Assignment + slip resolution.** A submittable `Salary Structure Assignment`
  (employee, salary structure, from date, base) records which structure applies
  from when. `SalaryAssignmentListener` fills a Salary Slip's `salary_structure`
  on save when it is blank, resolving the employee's latest submitted assignment
  effective on or before the slip's period start.
- **Validation gate.** A before_submit gate (`suppressErrors:false`) requires the
  from date, rejects an inactive salary structure, and blocks a second submitted
  assignment for the same employee on the same effective date.
- **Report.** A `salary-structure-assignment` report lists submitted assignments
  with employee, structure, from date, and base.

Verified: an assignment against an inactive structure was blocked ("is not
active"); a valid assignment effective 2026-01-01 submitted, and a duplicate on
the same date was blocked ("already has assignment SSA-… effective 2026-01-01");
a Salary Slip created without a structure resolved to the assigned one; the
report listed the assignment.

## Depreciation salvage-value floor (Phase 135)

Depreciation posting previously absorbed over-depreciation silently — a
Depreciation Entry's stated amount was clamped to the remaining depreciable
value on submit, so the entry could claim more than it posted. A gate now makes
the entry consistent and enforces the salvage floor.

- **Salvage-floor gate.** `DepreciationGateListener` blocks (before_submit,
  `suppressErrors:false`) any Depreciation Entry against a fully-depreciated
  asset, and any amount that would push the asset below its salvage value
  (`amount > gross − salvage − accumulated`).
- **Auto-filled amount.** before_save fills a blank amount with the asset's
  straight-line monthly charge `(gross − salvage) / life / 12`, clamped to the
  remaining depreciable value, so the entry's amount equals what posts.
- **Report.** A `depreciation-entry-register` report lists posted depreciation
  charges with asset, date, amount, and accounts.

Verified: an entry left blank auto-filled to 833.33 on a 12000/2000/1-year asset;
an amount of 11000 was blocked ("exceeds the remaining depreciable value 10000");
depreciating the full 10000 left the asset at its 2000 salvage value (Fully
Depreciated), and a further entry was blocked ("already fully depreciated"); the
register listed the posted charge.

## Contract renewal (Phase 136)

Contracts could be expired (a sweep flips Active contracts past their end date to
Expired) but there was no way to roll one into the next period. Renewal now draws
a follow-on contract and links the chain.

- **Renewal.** `POST /api/engagement/contract/:name/renew` creates a new draft
  Contract starting the day after the original ends, spanning the same duration
  (or a supplied number of days), copying party/value/terms and linked via
  `renewed_from`. The original is flagged `renewed` so it cannot be renewed
  twice.
- **Guards + revert.** Only a submitted, not-already-renewed contract can be
  renewed. Cancelling a renewal clears its parent's `renewed` flag, freeing it to
  be renewed again.
- **Report.** A `contract-renewals` report lists renewal contracts with their
  original, party, period, value, and status.

Verified: renewing a draft was refused ("Only a submitted contract can be
renewed"); renewing a submitted 2026 contract produced a draft starting
2027-01-01 linked to the original, which was flagged renewed; a second renewal
was blocked ("already been renewed"); cancelling the renewal reset the original's
flag; the report listed the renewal against its original.

## Recruitment (Phase 137)

A new recruitment domain: openings advertise vacancies, applicants apply against
them and move through a hiring pipeline.

- **Doctypes + hire.** `Job Opening` (title, vacancies, filled, status) and
  `Job Applicant` (name, opening, email, status Open/Shortlisted/Rejected/Hired).
  `RecruitmentService` exposes `POST /api/hr/applicant/:name/{shortlist,reject,hire}`.
  Hiring increments the opening's `filled` count.
- **Hire gates + auto-close.** Hiring refuses a Closed or fully-filled opening,
  an already-Hired applicant, or a Rejected one; shortlisting only applies to an
  Open applicant, and rejecting an already-Hired applicant is refused. When the
  last vacancy is filled the opening auto-closes.
- **Report.** A `recruitment-pipeline` report shows per-opening applicant counts
  by stage (applicants / shortlisted / hired) against the vacancy target.

Verified: an opening with one vacancy closed after its shortlisted applicant was
hired (filled 1/1); hiring a second applicant into the closed opening was blocked
("is Closed"); a rejected applicant could not be hired ("is Rejected"); re-hiring
the hired applicant was blocked ("already Hired"); the pipeline report showed 3
applicants / 1 hired / Closed.

## Job Offer (Phase 138)

Completes the recruitment bridge into HR: a Job Offer is extended to an
applicant and, on acceptance, creates the Employee.

- **Offer + accept.** A `Job Offer` (applicant, designation, CTC, status
  Draft/Accepted/Rejected/Withdrawn, created employee). `RecruitmentService`
  exposes `POST /api/hr/applicant/:name/make-offer` and
  `POST /api/hr/offer/:name/{accept,reject}`. Accepting a Draft offer creates an
  Employee from the applicant (name, designation), links it on the offer, and
  marks the applicant Hired.
- **Guards.** An offer cannot go to a Rejected applicant or to one that already
  has a live offer (Draft or Accepted). Only a Draft offer can be accepted or
  rejected.
- **Report.** A `job-offer-status` report lists offers with applicant,
  designation, CTC, status, and any employee created on acceptance.

Verified: offering a rejected applicant was blocked ("is Rejected"); a second
offer to the same applicant was blocked ("already has a live offer"); accepting
the offer created an Active Employee with the offered designation and moved the
applicant to Hired; re-accepting and rejecting the accepted offer were both
blocked ("only a Draft offer can be…"); a draft offer to another applicant was
rejected; the report showed the Accepted offer with its employee and the
Rejected one.

## Project costing & margin (Phase 139)

Projects rolled up billable revenue from timesheets but tracked no cost, so
margin was invisible. Timesheets now carry a labour cost that feeds a live
project margin.

- **Costing + margin rollup.** Timesheet gains `costing_rate` / `costing_amount`
  (hours × costing rate, on every line regardless of billability). On submit the
  `ProjectsListener` writes the costing amount onto the timesheet and rolls it
  into the project's `total_costing_amount`; the project's `gross_margin` =
  billable − cost is recomputed after each roll, and cancel unwinds the
  contribution.
- **Validation gate.** A before_submit gate (`suppressErrors:false`) rejects a
  timesheet with negative hours, billing rate, or costing rate so the rollups
  stay sane.
- **Report.** A `project-margin` report shows per-project hours, billable, cost,
  gross margin, and margin as a percentage of revenue.

Verified: a 10h billable timesheet (rate 100 / cost 40) put the project at
billable 1000 / cost 400 / margin 600; a 5h non-billable line (cost 40) took it
to cost 600 / margin 400 over 15 hours; timesheets with negative hours or a
negative costing rate were blocked; cancelling the first timesheet recomputed the
project to billable 0 / cost 200 / margin −200; the margin report reflected it.

## Leave Encashment (Phase 140)

Employees can convert unused leave into a payout, drawing down the same balance
the leave allocation/application flow maintains.

- **Encashment + balance + GL.** A submittable `Leave Encashment` (employee,
  leave type, days, amount) whose submitted days count against the leave
  balance — `balanceFor`/`balances` now net off submitted encashments alongside
  taken leave. On submit the payout is booked Dr Salary Expense / Cr Salaries
  Payable; cancel reverses the GL and restores the balance.
- **Balance gate.** A before_submit gate (`suppressErrors:false`) requires the
  days to be positive and no greater than the employee's current balance for the
  leave type (allocated − taken − already-encashed).
- **Report.** A `leave-encashment-register` report lists encashments with days,
  amount, and submit status.

Verified: with 20 days allocated, an encashment of 25 was blocked ("balance is
20"); encashing 8 dropped the balance to 12 and posted Dr Salary Expense 800 /
Cr Salaries Payable 800; a further 15 was blocked against the remaining 12;
cancelling the encashment restored the balance to 20 and removed its GL; the
register listed the encashments.

## Travel Request (Phase 141)

A travel-approval flow that feeds the expense system: an employee requests a
trip, it is approved, and the approved cost becomes an Expense Claim.

- **Request + approve + claim.** A `Travel Request` (employee, purpose, from/to
  dates, estimated cost, status Draft/Approved/Rejected/Claimed). `TravelRequestService`
  exposes `POST /api/hr/travel-request/:name/{approve,reject,make-expense-claim}`.
  Making the claim raises an Expense Claim for the estimated cost (one Travel
  expense line), links it back, and marks the request Claimed.
- **Guards.** Approve/reject apply only to a Draft request, and approval requires
  an ordered date range. A claim can be raised only from an Approved request and
  only once.
- **Report.** A `travel-request-status` report lists requests with their trip
  window, cost, status, and any raised claim.

Verified: claiming before approval was blocked ("only an Approved request can be
claimed"); approving an inverted date range was blocked; approving then claiming
produced an Expense Claim with a 1200 Travel line and moved the request to
Claimed; claiming again and rejecting the claimed request were both blocked; a
fresh draft rejected cleanly; the report showed the claimed, draft, and rejected
requests.

## Leave Policy (Phase 142)

A Leave Policy bundles a per-leave-type annual allocation; assigning it to an
employee provisions their leave for a period in one step, feeding the Phase 130
allocation flow.

- **Policy + assign.** A `Leave Policy` (name, active flag, `Leave Policy Detail`
  lines of leave type + annual allocation). `POST /api/hr/leave-policy/:name/assign`
  with `{employee, from_date, to_date}` creates and submits one Leave Allocation
  per line, returning the created allocations and any skipped lines.
- **Guards.** Assign requires the policy to have lines and an ordered date range;
  each allocation still passes the Leave Allocation gate (no overlap,
  non-negative), and a line that fails (e.g. an overlapping allocation) is
  reported as skipped instead of aborting the whole run.
- **Report.** A `leave-policy-summary` report lists each policy's leave-type
  annual allocations.

Verified: an inverted date range was rejected; assigning a two-line policy
(Annual 20 / Sick 10) created both allocations and left the employee with
balances of 20 and 10; re-assigning for an overlapping period created nothing and
skipped both lines with the overlap reason; the summary listed the policy's two
lines.

## Holiday List (Phase 143)

A dated calendar of non-working days, with weekly-off auto-population and a
working-day calculation for any range.

- **List + weekly-off population.** A `Holiday List` (name, from/to dates, a
  weekly-off setting, a `Holiday` grid, `total_holidays`). `total_holidays` is
  recomputed on every save, and `POST /api/hr/holiday-list/:name/populate-weekly-offs`
  inserts a holiday for each occurrence of the configured weekend day between the
  list's dates (skipping dates already present).
- **Working days.** `POST /api/hr/holiday-list/:name/working-days` returns the
  calendar days in a range minus the list's holidays that fall in it. Both
  endpoints reject an inverted date range; populate also rejects a list with no
  weekly off configured.
- **Report.** A `holiday-list-summary` report lists each holiday list with its
  coverage window, weekly-off, and holiday count.

Verified: a January-2026 list with one manual holiday populated its four Sundays
(total 5); the working-day count for 1–7 Jan returned 7 days − 2 holidays (New
Year + one Sunday) = 5; an inverted range and a populate with no weekly-off were
both rejected; the summary showed the list as Sunday / 5 holidays.

## Phase 144 — Item Alternative

Substitute items a planner can fall back on when a primary item is short, with
their live on-hand stock so an in-stock alternative can be picked at a glance.

- **Mapping + lookup.** An `Item Alternative` DocType (`item_code`,
  `alternative_item_code`, a `two_way` flag). `GET /api/stock/item/:code/alternatives`
  returns every alternative for the item — direct mappings plus the reverse side
  of any two-way mapping — each annotated with its current on-hand quantity summed
  across all `Bin` rows. Pure event-bus + SQL, no cross-module service imports.
- **Gates.** A `before_save:Item Alternative` listener (`suppressErrors:false`)
  rejects a self-alternative (an item mapped to itself) and a duplicate mapping
  for the same item→alternative pair.
- **Report.** An `item-alternatives` report lists every configured mapping with
  its item, alternative, and two-way flag.

Verified: with A→B (one-way) and C→A (two-way) mapped, the lookup for A returned
both B and C with their on-hand stock (25 and 7); a self-alternative and a
duplicate A→B mapping were each rejected with 400; the report listed both
mappings.

## Phase 145 — Employee Advance Return

Returning the unspent part of an employee advance — the mirror of paying it —
which shrinks the receivable the employee owes back.

- **Return + GL + settlement.** An `Employee Advance Return` DocType
  (submittable: `employee_advance`, `employee`, `posting_date`, `return_amount`,
  `return_to`, `advance_account`). On submit it books Dr the return-to account
  (Cash) / Cr Employee Advance for the returned amount and rolls the figure onto
  the parent advance's new `returned_amount` field; once the advance is fully
  worked down (`claimed + returned ≥ advance_amount`) it is marked Claimed.
  Cancel deletes the GL and rolls the return back (reverting a Claimed advance to
  Paid). Pure event-bus listener — HR imports no other module's services.
- **Gate.** A `before_submit:Employee Advance Return` listener
  (`suppressErrors:false`) requires the parent advance to be submitted and the
  return amount to be positive and within the outstanding balance
  (`advance − claimed − returned`).
- **Report.** An `employee-advance-return-register` report lists each submitted
  return with its advance and that advance's current outstanding balance.

Verified: a 1000 advance took a 300 return (Dr Cash 300 / Cr Employee Advance
300, advance still Paid) then a 700 return (advance fully settled → Claimed); a
further return, a zero-amount return, and a return against an unsubmitted advance
were each rejected with 400; cancelling the 700 return removed its GL and reverted
the advance to Paid with `returned_amount` back to 300; the register showed the
outstanding balance.

## Phase 146 — Vehicle preventive maintenance

Odometer-based service scheduling on top of the fleet running-cost tracker: each
vehicle carries a service interval, and a performed service re-arms when the next
one is due.

- **Service interval + re-arm.** A `Vehicle` gains `service_interval` (km) and a
  read-only `next_service_odometer`; a `Vehicle Log` gains an `is_service` flag.
  Submitting a log flagged `is_service` sets the vehicle's `next_service_odometer`
  to `odometer + service_interval` (a fresh service resets the due point). The
  existing fuel/service-cost rollup and monotonic-odometer gate are unchanged.
- **Gate.** The `before_submit:Vehicle Log` listener (`suppressErrors:false`) now
  also rejects a log flagged `is_service` that carries no positive service cost.
- **Report.** A `vehicles-service-due` report lists vehicles whose odometer has
  reached or passed `next_service_odometer`, with the overdue distance.

Verified: a service at 5 000 km on a vehicle with a 10 000 km interval set the
next service to 15 000; a fuel log driving the odometer to 16 000 left it overdue
by 1 000 (shown by the report); a service log with zero cost was rejected with
400; a fresh service at 16 500 reset the next service to 26 500 and cleared the
vehicle from the due list.

## Known limitations (still open)

- Multi-currency has a single conversion rate (no revaluation); serial numbers
  track status/movement but not per-serial valuation. Batches track per-batch
  on-hand, gate delivery on expiry, and auto-allocate by FEFO on Delivery Notes,
  but valuation is not per-batch and FEFO does not yet cover Sales Invoice
  `update_stock` or reserve against open reservations.
- Email is log-only without SMTP; SSE stream is unauthenticated (doctype + name
  only); webhooks/print are best-effort.
- POS offline retry can duplicate a *payment* (not the invoice) if the invoice
  submitted but the client never saw the response; GraphQL exposes no
  subscriptions yet.
- The DocType builder does not yet edit child-table field layouts in the UI.
- Pricing Rules apply a single best (highest-priority) match per line — no rule
  stacking or margin/validity-date windows. SLA deadlines are elapsed-hours
  based (no business-hours calendar, holidays, or pause). Payroll proration is
  attendance-day based only (no per-component LWP config, and deductions are not
  prorated).
- Subscriptions bill a single-line invoice per plan (no proration, tax templates,
  or dunning); loyalty redemption is recorded as a ledger entry but is not yet
  auto-applied as an invoice discount; a partial update that omits a child table
  replaces it (clients submit the whole document).
